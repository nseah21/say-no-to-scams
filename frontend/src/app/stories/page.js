                  that my bank account was frozen and he could help me resolve
                  the issue. He wanted me to wait for him to start the recovery

                  Hi Sara! It's Malcolm. Sharing my new number with you. Hey!
                  Got it, thanks for sharing. What's up? I got into an accident
                  on my bicycle going to work today. Can you help me cover some
                  of my aftercare medication costs? I need 150$ right now.
                  ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜§omg, M! where are you? Yes, I can send some money in the
                  next hour.

                  The sudden request for money due to an unexpected accident is
                  a common tactic used by scammers to elicit sympathy and
                  financial assistance. Verify the identity of the person
                  through other means before sending any money. Do not rush into
                  sending money based on emotional appeals without confirming
                  the situation.
