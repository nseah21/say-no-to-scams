Anonymous , 26 May 2024,Job Scam,"I came across a job scam promising high pay with commission for working from home, Monday to Friday, 10am to 6pm.
Pretending to be from: MMI Group Media
Here’s how it started: The company claimed they found your resume on a job website and offered you an easy admin job processing hotel bookings for Agoda, Booking.com, and Trip.com. Initially, they build trust by paying you via PayNow for completing tasks, with payment on the same day.
However, on the second day, they ask you to pay for hotel bookings, promising to reimburse you plus a commission. They lead you to a room where you're presented with multiple bookings to pay even more. Some people post screenshots showing they transferred money to the company, but these are insiders trying to make you feel safe about transferring money. Once you pay, they ask for more money for additional bookings, claiming your group won't get paid unless you complete the bookings. They use guilt and fake testimonials to coerce you into paying more.

Anonymous , 26 May 2024,Internet Love Scam,"I met Sam on CMB in April 2024. According to his profile, he is from Australia but stays in Malaysia and works as a property project developer. Throughout our conversations on the app, he was polite and never pushy. Before our chatroom closed, I gave him my phone number for coffee if he came over to Singapore.
Once we were on WhatsApp, he began professing his love for me, citing that I was different from his previous partners. He even insisted that we both delete our CMB profiles, which he did before me. He was attentive and remembered every detail I shared with him. However, the red flag was his refusal to meet up, even though we were just across the causeway. We chatted over text and WhatsApp calls for close to two months. Over the phone, he sounded Australian and spoke very well.
During this time, he built up a story about rushing to complete his project and meeting me in Singapore in another two months. He also painted a beautiful picture of bringing me home to Sydney to meet his mum. He offered to do video calls, but somehow the video quality was always terrible and barely lasted for 30 seconds.
After nearly two months of being in touch, he shared that the project's investor delayed his payment, and he needed to pay his workers from his personal funds. He also said that, in a bid to meet me earlier, he made the workers work overtime, which depleted his personal funds. He asked me for a loan of SGD 6,000. I refused, but he pestered me endlessly for two days. After this failed attempt, he disappeared, likely realising I was a bad candidate.",Name: Sam / Samuel wang,Contact: 60149603545,

Next, they increased the job's difficulty by asking me to cart out items with very small amounts involved, around $2-3. They reimbursed me the amount paid with much better rewards ($10-50).
At certain times of the day, they introduced higher return jobs (20-40%). They sent a link to create an account to complete the work order. First, I was asked to transfer the amount I wanted to work on, and they assigned the same amount of credits into the work page. After completing the task, I informed them in the Telegram group. They then told me there was another work order from the merchant that I needed to complete to get back the money I put in for the first job.
There were no refunds if I didn't follow their instructions to complete all tasks. If I did complete them, they promised extra returns. ",Name: Lewis vishal so nahaiyan and ho kuo hsing,Contact: 87539359,

Anonymous , 13 Apr 2024,Job Scam,"I joined a WhatsApp group where all I had to do was like Shopee shops to get paid. Curious, I decided to give it a shot. They paid me through PayNow after making me add someone (a receptionist) on Telegram.
There were two groups: one for tasks and another where everyone shared their earnings and asked questions. Most seemed like unknowing users like myself, or so I thought from their questions.
I was encouraged to keep doing simple tasks like Shopee shops, with occasional tasks where we paid $5 or less to order an item to a specific address (Royal Logistics SG408868, Tel: 8481 7066, which I suspect is involved in the scam).
I received payment for every $18 earned (which equates to 6 tasks), with at least 1 purchase task in the mix. Everything went smoothly, and I got paid 4 times.
Then came multiple tasks where you could choose the amount to pay, ranging from $70 to $2000++, promising 20-50% cashback. I opted for the $70 one, thinking I didn't have much to lose since I'd made money from completing tasks.
I was given a PayNow number to transfer the money. I was asked to create an account on a website and then contact another person on Telegram. I was told to complete 30 ""reviews"" on the website.
But when I finished the tasks, I was informed that the merchant task usually involved 2-4 tasks, so the money I paid wasn't enough to continue, and I needed to top up a minimum of $85 more. I was told I couldn't get any refund or withdraw any cash until I completed the task via the website. I also couldn't continue any tasks from the group until my current task was completed, and I had to pay to continue doing anything.
Despite my suspicions, I decided to pay another $85 since I'd already paid once. Not surprisingly, I was told I couldn't withdraw because I needed to complete another task, this time with a minimum of $100+.
Realising what was going on, I stopped and tried to warn the others in the group to be careful about being scammed. However, they all shrugged it off, even commenting that I was a ""first-timer"" and should just pay and continue. It was then that I realized most of the ""members"" were probably scammers too.","Name: Jenson,Belinda",Contact: 85220853,

However, by the 6th task, costs escalated to over $250. I deposited more money but grew concerned about potential scams, especially when faced with a sudden $1.6k task cost. Despite my research efforts, including contacting Fiverr to verify Jobcraft's affiliation (which was denied), I had already deposited $300 and faced demands for an additional $1.3k. Midway through the 3rd project, I received a scam alert, as I was required to transfer money to a random PayNow number to access my account funds. The manager, Jessica, may not be the only alias used.

Anonymous , 29 Dec 2023,Impersonation Scam,"On the evening of 17 December 2023, I received a phone call from a friend named ""Stan"", who informed me that he had lost his phone and wallet. He provided his new phone number and mentioned that he was planning to open a cafe on December 23rd, a Saturday, and invited me to attend the opening.

I expressed uncertainty about my availability and ended the call. On the afternoon of 22 December 2023, around 2pm, ""Stan"" urgently called me, stating that he needed $1,600 to pay a supplier promptly to ensure the timely delivery of goods for the cafe's opening the next day. He requested me to lend him the amount and instructed me to use PayNow to transfer the funds to a supplier named Anna.

Given that I didn't have the full amount, I offered to provide $500. Stan agreed, and I promptly transferred the amount to Anna. Subsequently, Stan pleaded with me for an additional $1,100 to prevent losing his deposit. He assured me that he would repay the full $1,600 after 5pm, as that's when his bank's OTP would be available.

Reluctantly, I transferred another $1,100 to Anna. However, Stan called again, this time requesting $2,000. I informed him that I couldn't afford any more assistance and suggested seeking help from his wife or business partner. He claimed that his friend had promised to lend him the money but couldn't due to his friend's wife's objection. ""Stan"" urged me to borrow from my credit or work colleagues, but I firmly declined, stating that I had already provided enough assistance.

Suspicion arose, but it was too late. I waited until 5pm as agreed, but Stan's phone was no longer in use. Despite my doubts, I proceeded to make a police report online and contacted both the Trust Bank and DBS Bank. Unfortunately, they informed me that there was little they could do except attempt to recall the funds.

The amount may seem small, but it covers my bills and expenses until my next payday. This incident has left me feeling down and sad, as it was my entire current assets. I later verified with my actual friend, who confirmed that the real Stan had not changed his phone number and was at home resting due to COVID.

The contact information for the fake friend ""Stan"" is 8079 1512, and for the purported supplier ""Anna"" is 8543 5596.

The job promises daily earnings of $150-$300, but requires a Singapore bank account, stable internet, and is offered by a contact based in Indonesia. If you accept, a Singapore partner will provide job training, starting with a practice account on the website ""https://www.pic-ka-so50.com.""

After training, you'll create a working account with a $50-$150 bonus as an initial balance. To qualify for payment, you need to complete at least 2 sets of 40 tasks daily. After 5 days, you receive a base salary of $800 on top of your commissions. A 10-day check-in yields $1600, and 30-day check-in gives $4000.

Tasks come in two types: normal and combination. You must click ""Start 40/40"" for each. Normal tasks are low-cost with a 0.25% commission, while combination tasks are more expensive but offer a 1.5% commission. However, if a costly combination task depletes your balance, you must deposit more to continue.

I initially deposited $100, earned $125 in one day for 3 sets of 40 tasks, and withdrew. On the second day, I deposited $100 but encountered frequent costly combination tasks, leaving my balance at -$444. After depositing $500 to continue, another combination task drained my balance to -$1558. I had to deposit $1558 more to offset this negative balance, but I could not finish the task, trapping me in a loss of $600.",Name: pickaso,Contact: 62831516464908,

Anonymous , 24 Oct 2023,Job Scam,"I received a WhatsApp message about a commission-based job that involved promoting a hotel through a company called Visibility Media Pte Ltd, in collaboration with Agoda, Booking.com, and Trip.com.

Before accepting the job, I conducted online checks to verify the company's legitimacy. The company had positive reviews on various job search platforms, and even a Google search for potential scams turned up nothing concerning. I attempted to schedule an interview with the ""HR"" person, but they claimed to be in a meeting, so our communication primarily took place via WhatsApp.

Since it was a work-from-home opportunity, with no request for my bank details as I was in a trial period for two weeks, I decided to give it a try. Payment would be through PayNow, and there was no formal interview or employment agreement, making it easy to test the waters for a few hours.

I received a link to contact my reporting supervisor on Telegram. The job involved working with Agoda Booking Europe/Asia and included both prepaid and commission-based tasks. The company would pay through PayNow, and the working hours were 10 am to 6 pm daily, including weekends.

On the first day, I received a prepaid job order where I had to copy and paste hotel booking details to receive a code as part of the job. I was asked to complete the prepaid task and choose the lowest payment option. My supervisor insisted that this was part of the job and advised me to select $20 as I was a first-timer. After providing a screenshot of the transfer, I was paid within 5 minutes. My supervisor and I earned a 2% commission based on the hotel booking rate, and I was paid $29 that day.

On the second day, I received another prepaid task, this time for $228, and an additional task within the same order for a second transfer of $633. Other team members also started sharing proof of their transfers, assuring me that it was normal and that they always received their money back. They stressed that if anyone in the team failed to transfer, they couldn't retrieve their money. Feeling pressured to complete my tasks and release my team members' funds, I made my third transfer of $1,839. This pattern continued, and I found myself completing a fourth transfer of $3,057.

Initially, I felt comfortable with the job because many people were participating and providing evidence of payment. However, as the transfers piled up, and I faced an additional task related to air ticket orders, I decided to stop after my fifth transfer, which totaled $5,817. At this point, I realized I was caught in a job scam and promptly reported it to the police.",Name: visibility media pte ltd,Contact:,

Day 2 - He called, seeking help with updating his mobile number on the DBS app. He claimed he'd spoken to DBS and could do it through the app but was unsure where. He sent a screenshot of the DBS app, and I guided him on how to update his number.

He later called, stating he had successfully updated his mobile number, but it would take 5-12 hours to take effect. He urgently needed money for his renovation contractor. Only then did I realize something was amiss and began questioning him. He tried to convince me, citing our friendship and blaming my supposed poor internet connection for not allowing a video call.

We started a conversation, and this scammer displayed an impressive knowledge of Singapore, including our unique slangs like ""ps,"" ""kia su,"" ""diao kia,"" ""la,"" ""meh,"" and ""sia."" Honestly, it felt as though I was talking to a genuine Singaporean. The scammer even sent me screenshots of conversations with their friends in a group chat, discussing topics such as restaurants in Singapore, like Swee Choon Dim Sum, where they enjoyed supper, and even showed a picture of grapes they bought from Don Don Donki, complete with the price tag in Singapore dollars. Additionally, they shared handwritten love letters from their ex and showed familiarity with various Singaporean foods like Hokkien mee, teh bing, and kopi o kosong.

However, some things didn't quite add up. Within about a week, our conversation took a sudden and unwelcome turn toward more explicit content. They began to request explicit photos, which, of course, I refused to provide. At this point, it seemed their interest waned, and they suggested a meetup, to which I agreed. Unfortunately, they never showed up for the scheduled meeting, and our communication abruptly ended about three days ago.

While their knowledge and communication style suggested a Singaporean background, there were inconsistencies in their behavior. They professed their affection far too quickly, despite barely knowing me, and engaged in excessive sweet talk.

Anonymous , 17 Sep 2023,Impersonation Scam,"A scammer attempted to video call me via WhatsApp. Normally, I am cautious when I see a call with a ""+"" sign, as it often indicates a potential scam. However, this time, I answered the call because the profile picture on WhatsApp appeared to be from MOM (Ministry of Manpower). Additionally, I was anxiously awaiting the approval of my S-Pass permit renewal, which led me to respond.
Upon answering the video call, I saw the scammer dressed like an immigration officer, wearing a face mask, with a backdrop featuring a MOM tarpaulin. Initially, one scammer asked me to show my IC card, and then they transferred me to another scammer who requested to see my ATM card and passport. They also inquired about my country of origin and my intended return date.
Things took a suspicious turn when they asked for my ATM PIN code and requested confirmation of a notification for changing it, which I initially complied with. However, when they asked me to confirm a notification on my mobile device for accessing my online bank account, I grew suspicious and decided to play along. I pretended that I hadn't received the notification and quickly turned off my mobile phone for a moment.
During this brief pause, I searched Google for information related to the ""+92 scam"" and found an article that confirmed my suspicions: it was indeed a scam. I immediately turned my phone back on to inform my friends via WhatsApp and warn them about the scammer. I also sent a message to the scammer on WhatsApp, calling them out and noting their repeated attempts to call me when my phone was off.
Fortunately, the scammer did not succeed in scamming me further, but I had already revealed my personal information, including my ATM card, passport, and IC. I'm concerned that this information could be misused for illegal activities.

Anonymous , 16 Sep 2023,Online Purchase Scam,"The scammer posed as a buyer representing ""Nanyang Polytechnic"" and expressed interest in purchasing high-value goods amounting to SGD 23,000. We requested a purchase order (PO) from Nanyang Polytechnic's official email address, but the scammer claimed urgency and was unwilling to wait. Instead, they fabricated a fake PO and sent it via WhatsApp from the number 914918??. They also provided us with the contact information of a supposed vendor who could supply the items.
Shortly thereafter, the vendor unexpectedly contacted us, claiming to have the goods that a customer was seeking. To add to the deception, the scammer forwarded a fabricated DBS transfer receipt, insisting that the items were needed within a few hours. The fake vendor then pressured us over the phone to send them money to release the goods for the scammer, emphasizing the need for swift action.
Suspicions arose when we realized it was the weekend, and Nanyang Polytechnic does not operate its offices on weekends. Moreover, we understood that we required an official domain-registered email from the polytechnic to our company email. Consequently, we halted the scammer's attempt to defraud us.

After a day of messaging on CMB, we switched to WhatsApp. He said he was a Malaysian Chinese and a Singapore PR.

At the start of our conversation, he mentioned he'd been scammed, losing access to his Instagram account. This left him without any social media presence. He later sent a video of himself deleting CMB from his phone, but the recording lacked date, time, and screen-recording icon.

For about two weeks, he called me every night to chat. During one conversation, he said he'd been invited by a client/mentor, a ""director of Hong Leong Bank,"" to participate in a fundraiser for HDB BTO in Tampines. He even shared a video of a BTO along Bedok Reservoir Road. However, he missed the opportunity due to a delayed response.

Later, he mentioned another chance to join a fundraiser, this time for HDB BTO in Tampines Green Opal. He asked if I could take some photos, and I agreed.

Then, he claimed his client/mentor flew to KL to meet him. This person encouraged him to reward me, and he asked for help in obtaining an invitation code for the fundraiser. He explained that with a $500 investment, I could gain $60 within hours, though he couldn't clarify how earnings would be possible if the BTO wasn't completed yet.

The post emphasized that it was not a scam or illegal activity. The purchases would be made using the company's funds, with only our bank details required.

He mentioned that he had changed his number, and the old one was no longer in use. I verified his identity by asking a question only he would know, and I saved his new number.
The following morning, he WhatsApped me a screenshot of a bank account and asked for assistance in updating his phone number on his bank account. I called him and guided him through the update process.
He later called to inform me that the bank needed 12 hours to complete the update and sent me a notification showing that his details had been successfully updated. He then mentioned that he needed to PayNow $2,800 to one of his subcontractors for tiling work, but due to the update, he couldn't. He asked if I could help him by paying $2,800 first, promising to transfer the money back later when his new number was updated.
He provided me with a screenshot containing a phone number (81597931), the recipient's name, and an amount typical for such work. Believing it was legitimate, I called him for an invoice number, which he promptly provided. I unwittingly made the PayNow payment and sent him the screenshot.
A few minutes later, he called again, claiming that one of his friends was supposed to transfer him $7,000 for completed work, but their transfer limit was $3,000. He asked if I could help with the $7,000 transfer. I informed him that I had reached my transfer limit and would need to check with someone else. I hung up.

Anonymous , 22 Aug 2023,Investment Scam,"A few weeks ago, Tim contacted me on Facebook with the intention of becoming friends. Our conversation shifted to Telegram. After chatting for a while, he requested a favor – assistance in accessing his trading investment account on www.ezagvip.com for a cryptocurrency transaction. Following this transaction, he boasted about a 10% profit and championed the idea that using money to earn money was the smartest choice.

As I helped him succeed in this transaction, he invited me to join the investment platform. I agreed and completed the registration process, including uploading my identification documents. Tim guided me through my initial trade, resulting in a 10% profit, which the platform's customer service transferred to my bank account.

Tim repeatedly encouraged me to raise my investment, promising favorable returns in what he described as scarce money-making opportunities. Starting with an initial SGD 1,000, I increased my balance fivefold through platform and e-wallet transfers. Despite doubts, I increased it further, influenced by my success in three trades during that period.

When Tim urged me to double the balance for an impending ""big trading transaction,"" pressure mounted. Deciding to withdraw everything, I faced difficulties transferring to my e-wallet. The platform's customer service informed me of a frozen account due to suspected money laundering detected by their trading system. To unfreeze it, they insisted on an equivalent deposit, which I made in fear.

Thereafter, customer service announced an investigation, threatening account cancellation within 72 hours. Realizing the situation, I cut ties with the platform and ceased further investments. Tim disappeared from my life, another casualty of a deceitful scheme.

To this day, Tim's Facebook and Instagram accounts (@oyt19891? / @oytian77?) remain active.",Name: tim oy / @oyt19891? and @oytian77? / www.ezagvip.com,Contact: 6588771497,
Anonymous , 22 Aug 2023,Investment Scam,"About a month ago, a girl I met on the online dating app Tantan introduced me to a network that initially appeared to be a genuine marketplace platform. It allowed users to set up shops and curate items for sale. When orders were placed, the process involved funding your store wallet with USDT before fulfilling the order. After shipping, earnings were deposited into the wallet. However, instead of allowing withdrawals, the platform required frequent recharging to manage incoming orders.

Initially, orders were small, but they grew in scale, demanding more substantial funds. The situation became clearer when attempting to close the store and halt order processing. The closing procedure mandated injecting additional funds, supposedly to settle issues like restoring a lowered store rating to 100. Ultimately, the platform demanded payment for sales and profit taxes, an amount three times higher than the actual profit from the goods.

These steps were executed incrementally, preventing early detection and intervention. During this process, withdrawing the initially deposited funds was prohibited until compliance with the platform's demands. The girl who introduced me, posing as a successful store owner, guided these actions and insisted on following instructions from the customer service team.

He mentioned staying in a condo at Bukit Timah and owning a car. He referenced a close friend, Chris, who is a Sea Limited boss.
Midweek, Jackson abruptly said his grandmother fell and he rushed to KL. While waiting for updates on his grandmother's condition, he urgently asked me to photograph an ongoing HDB development in Toa Payoh. I complied and sent the pictures. He claimed these helped him secure a $500k high-yield investment by Sea Limited, with Chris inviting me to join.
Next, he provided me an invitation ID for a Sea Limited-backed platform. I input personal details, including my legal name, FIN number, bank info, and created login credentials. Jackson assured me this was legitimate, showing platform details and certifications. He convinced me to invest $3,000, and oddly, I had to request banking instructions via chat to deposit the money into a private account for ""security reasons.""

She requested my WhatsApp number for easier communication, which I provided. She initiated texting, but consistently focused on learning about me rather than sharing about herself. When I sought her social media profiles to verify her authenticity, she made excuses like it being for family and friends or not using Instagram anymore. At the time, I attributed this behavior to past negative experiences.

Every night, she mentioned her part-time job, and I didn't mind. On the third night, she asked for my help to let her ""rest early."" Out of kindness, I assisted her, initially engaging in tasks for mytheresa.singapore. However, they didn't provide much guidance or warnings. Costs escalated swiftly from a few hundred dollars to thousands. During the third order, they requested I buy three products, without mentioning the need for another three. Having already purchased three items, this inconsistency raised suspicion. When they demanded another purchase, I realized it was a scam. They used threats of ""liquid damage"" and pressure for payment. My request to see a contract agreement was evaded.

At this point, I blocked both numbers, reported the incident to the police and my bank. Please stay vigilant when dealing with such matters.

The following day, they claimed to be from the HR department at Singapore Travel Hub, offering a merchandiser position. This job sounded similar to one I had applied for online.

Li Liazhi then introduced me to another person named Erica via Telegram. The role involved forwarding hotel booking orders to an Agoda employee named Aminahuddin, supposedly to boost bookings for hotels with vacancies. The task was to post a booking every 30 minutes. Once completed, a booking code needed to be shared with Erica. The pay was SGD 1,500 per month along with a 2% commission on each order.

Initially, I had some questions and their answers seemed satisfactory. I believed that there might indeed be a business model where hotels aimed to enhance their ratings by creating a perception of high demand. However, as time went on, doubts arose.

My first day yielded a transfer of $70 to my bank account. On the second day, I was given prepaid orders. Among them, I had to select one, transfer the requested amount to a Paulynow number, and then almost immediately receive a refund, including the commission. I decided not to proceed with the second task that required prepayment.

Subsequently, I was informed that I couldn't participate in other tasks until I completed the prepayment task. Feeling suspicious, I chose to discontinue my involvement.

He claimed to be 34 years old, from Kuching, Malaysia, and had worked in Singapore for 8 years. He occasionally spoke in a Malaysian accent when using Chinese. Aziel portrayed himself as coming from a wealthy family and holding a high-flying position as a Cyber Security Consultant at KPMG/IBM. He mentioned casually that he owned assets like a 4-bedroom condo and a car, probably to illustrate his well-to-do background.
We planned a first date, but he suddenly said he had to attend a work conference in Jakarta for two weeks. Despite the distance, we continued our daily phone calls, during which he slowly introduced information about his finances and investments. He mentioned making profits through a secret private investing platform that involved the collaboration of the Singapore government, Hong Leong Group, and GuocoLand. Aziel claimed he mostly invested in BTO projects on the platform and would get help to recce the sites before visiting them. Naively, I offered to help him with the recce since it was close to where I lived, and I sent him a video of the site.
The next day, he said he trusted me and wanted to share an opportunity to make profits by inviting me to the exclusive private investing platform. This happened 2 to 3 weeks after we connected. He explained that a user could generate only one invite link, which would expire in a day, so I had to register immediately. It was then that I began to suspect something was not right.
The platform was a website (HTTP://WWW.PVPLMGCPRO.COM), which has already been blocked, and the scammers took it down afterwards.

Kelvin volunteered to teach me and set up a crypto and DeFi wallet. Starting with a small amount, I managed to withdraw the funds successfully. He constantly persuaded me to invest more, promising safe and profitable returns, as he had been doing it for two years.

Anonymous , 19 Jul 2023,Job Scam,"Recently, I received a text via WhatsApp offering a part-time job opportunity related to optimizing the ranking of apps. The job sounded promising, and after a phone training session, I was asked to start the next day.

The job involved accessing the website ""rocket10-star.work"" and clicking on specific buttons. However, before each click, I was required to make payments to the supposed app developers. The promise was that I would receive a commission after the ""optimization"" process. Additionally, I was told that after 40 clicks, I could withdraw all the money, including the principal and commission.

The trouble began when I started the job the following day. I encountered two deals that required me to pay more than I had initially deposited. I was asked to top up my account through PayNow and was provided with a customer service number to get the account numbers.

The trainer insisted that topping up was necessary to complete the transactions and gain the promised commission. Initially, I deposited SGD 100, followed by SGD 379, and then had to top up SGD 1089. However, the website showed a negative value, indicating that I owed the company SGD 1089.

The catch was that they controlled the amount I had to pay before each transaction, often setting exorbitant prices. This made it challenging to reach the 40-click requirement to receive the commission. By this point, I had already invested in previous deposits and top-ups, which I would lose if I didn't complete the 40 transactions.

To avoid detection, it seems they set up various websites to host their app, such as ""rocket10-it,"" ""rocket10-star,"" and ""rocket10-work.""

To protect yourself from falling into this scam, avoid part-time jobs with marketing or ranking companies like Rocket10 that offer unusually high daily pay rates of SGD 50-150. Be cautious if the individuals involved have phone numbers from India or Africa and if you cannot find any information about their website on Google.

Never engage in a job that requires you to put money upfront without receiving anything in return immediately. Moreover, be wary if you can only receive the promised commission after completing a specific number of transactions, as this can be manipulated against you.

In my experience, the scammers behind this elaborate scheme went through a half-hour training session and added me to a WhatsApp group with seemingly fake members. When I refused to pay, the group's chatter immediately stopped, and it became evident that they were good at acting, with some pretending to be newbies.

Anonymous , 10 Jul 2023,Job Scam,"I accepted a friend request on Facebook because we had a common friend. We chatted on Facebook Messenger and did some basic verification by asking questions, which seemed believable. We then decided to continue the conversation on WhatsApp. This ""friend"" attempted to develop a close relationship by asking personal questions and showing concern for various issues I had.

After some time, they asked me to help them with a part-time job they were doing. They claimed that if I didn't assist, it would indicate a lack of sincerity in our friendship. I accepted the request but remained cautious, even though I didn't know much about the background of the job. The task involved processing sales orders for a supposedly reputable company. I was asked to use my own money to purchase items using the product value provided in links sent by the ""company"" through Paynow. To help my friend, I needed to complete a certain number of orders.

Initially, the purchase amount was small, around $100. After completing a few orders and being fully reimbursed along with commission, the subsequent orders' amounts quickly ballooned into the thousands. Feeling uncomfortable, I decided to stop paying for the orders.

When I raised my concerns about this issue, my ""friend"" began to change their behavior and accused me of not completing the orders intentionally to cause problems for them. They insisted that I fulfill the job due to an alleged contract and threatened that they would face penalties otherwise. Refusing their demands led to them hurling expletives at me and instructing me not to contact them again. I immediately took screenshots of all their details and ceased communication.

Fortunately, I didn't lose any money during the process, but my banking details were compromised. I reported the incident to the police.

Reflecting on the situation, the scammer was well-prepared in answering various questions and made a concerted effort to build a seemingly sincere relationship. When the time came, they resorted to emotional blackmail and questioned my integrity to manipulate me into assisting them. I urge others to remain vigilant for red flags in their responses, conduct internet searches to verify the information provided, and immediately cease contact to avoid becoming emotionally entangled with scammers, which can result in financial losses.",Name: Elva Chen,Contact: 81790417,

However, the next day, I discovered that he had unmatched me on Bumble and claimed to have uninstalled the app. Then, he sent me a message showing a graph of SGX stocks, explaining that he was making extra money from it because his $7,000 salary wasn't sufficient to cover his $2,000 rent and family expenses. He mentioned that his brother had taught him about stocks, or else he would have lost a significant amount of money. He said he thought I was a nice girl and offered to teach me some tips in exchange for a meal. This made me even more suspicious, so I turned him down.

According to him, he is from Malaysia and studied at Inti International University and College Malaysia. He claimed to own a 3.7 million worth condominium near Orchard and a car, which he purchased from his aunt who migrated to Australia.

Arno shared that he worked under his boss, David, who is the head of the Department of SEA Ltd. He claimed to have connections with David, allowing him to invest in private equity projects exclusive to high-end members. These projects involved HDB projects and more. About a week into chatting on WhatsApp, he suddenly informed me that he urgently needed to go to Kuala Lumpur as his grandmother had fallen and hit her head. He showed me a picture of his grandmother admitted to Hospital Pantai KL. A few days later, he shared another picture of his grandmother after her operation. He then asked for my help to visit an HDB worksite and take photos, to give him reassurance regarding his $0.5 million investment in the project's progress. Later, he claimed that he managed to get David's help to let me join the private equity platform called ""SoftUni"" as a token of appreciation. He immediately insisted that I join without allowing me time to consider. The registration process required my legal name and NRIC. The next day, Arno informed me about small-scale projects that I could join, each requiring a passcode for access.

Arno recommended three successful investments, and I received funds through withdrawals. However, in the latest investment on June 30, 2023, he informed me that my funds were frozen due to an incorrect password entered during the withdrawal process, even though I'm confident that I entered the correct password. I reached out to customer service for resolution and was told that I needed to transfer the same amount to unfreeze my funds. Arno convinced me to follow the advice from customer service. After transferring the funds, the initial amount was unfrozen. When I tried to withdraw the entire amount, the withdrawal was rejected. I contacted customer service and was informed that I needed to transfer an additional amount of $50,000 to perform the withdrawal. At this point, I realized it was a scam and conducted some research on scam alerts. I found similar stories with the same modus operandi.

Anonymous , 04 Jul 2023,Investment Scam,"I met a guy on a social app who offered to teach me about investing. We moved our conversations to Telegram, where he introduced me to two apps: crypto.com and Max Magic Exchange (MME). He seemed friendly and helpful, providing step-by-step instructions on how to use the apps. He claimed to have two years of trading experience on MME and said he learned about investing from his uncle, whom he currently worked for in Singapore. He presented himself as a Taiwanese looking for new local friends.
As we continued interacting, he encouraged me to invest larger amounts on MME after showing me a few successful investments. However, I became suspicious due to several occurrences:
He strongly advocated for MME, even when I raised concerns about the lack of information on the site and received no response from their customer service.
Whenever I requested to withdraw profits and my initial investment, he threatened me with timed penalties (often within 7 days). For instance, he asked me to deposit a larger sum to avoid a penalty deduction of 30% to 50% from my account balance.
He consistently requested larger and more absurd deposits each time.
Every time I tried to withdraw my funds, he came up with ridiculous excuses to prevent the withdrawal. These reasons ranged from not having enough investment activities logged, insufficient deposits for the requested amount, and even a demand for a 25% national tax payment on my total earnings. He also claimed that my earnings were too significant to be transferred out and required an additional deposit.

Then, I was directed to visit a website (https://tech-pricelineonline.com) and create a Priceline Work Account using the invitation code 18950768.

After creating my account, I was given a login with the username ""Gavin1002"" and password ""123456"" to access the training.

To clear the negative balance, I was asked to deposit additional funds.

After completing tasks for 5 days, I received $800 USD as my ""salary"" in my account. Unfortunately, I forgot to withdraw this amount before starting the next set of tasks. As a result, the value of the hotels increased, leading to increased profit.

I contacted customer service on the platform and they assured me that the chances of encountering another combination task were almost zero. Believing them, I proceeded to deposit the money. However, when I reached the 40th task of that set, I encountered another combination task that required me to deposit $10,600 USD to clear the negative balance. I was told that this would be the last task and I could withdraw all my money after completing it.

Before depositing the money, I asked customer service if there was any possibility of encountering further obstacles, and they assured me there were none.

Anonymous , 25 Jun 2023,Internet Love Scam,"I met Leo on the CMB app, and he was very responsive and interested in getting to know me. Within the first day, he suggested moving our chats to WhatsApp, which I agreed to. Leo would send daily updates and constantly inquire about my activities and meals. We had frequent communication and nightly phone calls, where he would share details of his day, creating the illusion of a relationship.
Leo had a Malaysian accent and spoke Chinese. His English proficiency was limited. He claimed to work at Garena under the supervision of Gangye, one of the co-founders. According to him, he lived at Margaret Ville condo and owned a white Porsche. He boasted about having a personal assistant and claimed a monthly salary of 30k with an annual compensation of 1.7m. He described his role as heading the sales operations team at Garena and mentioned traveling four times a year to oversee the regional team.
Occasionally, Leo would try to extract more information from me, such as my monthly salary and spending habits.
One week into our conversations, Leo abruptly messaged me at 2:47 am, stating that he had to rush to Kuala Lumpur as his grandmother had fallen and was hospitalized. Despite this, he continued to call me at night, shifting the topic to his investments in BTO projects. He sent me a website link for a BTO project near my house and claimed that he needed my help to take a picture of the site the next day, or else he would miss the opportunity to invest.
Feeling suspicious, I questioned why HDB would require money for BTO projects. Leo's explanation about COVID-related delays and a temporary 60-day loan to HDB did not convince me. When he mentioned a 20% return on the investment, I knew it was unrealistic, given my own knowledge of the finance industry. I immediately conducted an internet search on love scams and discovered that he was indeed a scammer.",Name: leo,Contact: 91975200,

Initially, I made a transfer of $100 to a seemingly verified LV customer service account and received some money back. The person kept asking for more help, and in a moment of vulnerability, I continued transferring money. It quickly escalated, and I ended up losing control, eventually reaching $25,000. Realizing the depth of the situation, a friend helped me regain my senses, and we immediately filed a police report and contacted the bank. Despite the account being frozen, recovering the funds is unlikely as they may have been transferred overseas. Early reporting has slim chances of success as well.

She immediately reached out to me, claiming she rarely uses Facebook and suggested we chat on WhatsApp instead (number: 84831876). In our conversations, she mentioned that she is a permanent resident with a Singaporean father and a Malaysian mother. Despite being Chinese, she occasionally typed in Chinese.
We continued chatting, getting to know each other as new friends. She shared details about her daily life and seemed sincere in our interactions. She told me she was 28 years old and working in HR. Additionally, she mentioned having a part-time job at Style Tribute, where she needed to handle numerous orders.
After a couple of days, she complained about working late into the night to complete orders for Style Tribute, expressing discomfort in her neck and other issues. She even invited me for a coffee date. However, she added a condition: she needed my help to complete her orders so she could sleep early.
I sensed something was amiss with her request. How could she trust a new friend she barely knew for just two days? When I refused to assist her, she asked if I shopped online. I falsely claimed that I didn't. She responded by saying even a child knows how to shop online using a smartphone. I suggested she could ask a child to help her with the orders.
Immediately, she bid me farewell, claiming that chatting with me was a waste of her time and even telling me to ""go die."" Fortunately, I had read stories about similar scams and recognized her seemingly sincere intentions to date me were merely a trap.

Anonymous , 21 Jun 2023,Internet Love Scam,"I recently encountered an individual named Ivan Koh Wei M??? (alleged DOB: 28/7/1991) on the dating app CMB. He claimed to be working as a business manager at Credit Suisse for the past five years and holds PR status in Singapore. Ivan stated that he owned a resale condo in River Valley and a car, with his hometown being Kuala Lumpur.

Ivan persuaded me to continue our conversation on Telegram, where he employed charming and sweet messages to gain my trust. Despite my initial inactivity on Telegram, he made consistent efforts to engage me, sharing photos of his daily life, family, work, and even indulging in suggestive conversations. He acted extremely eager to become my boyfriend and expressed a strong desire to introduce me to his family in Kuala Lumpur. In fact, he went to the extent of sending me an unsolicited explicit photo, which I firmly reprimanded him for. His communication skills were impeccable, demonstrating a deep understanding of how to manipulate and counter psychological defenses. His story appeared flawless, leaving no room for doubt.

Upon my return from overseas, Ivan informed me of a business trip to Taiwan, where he claimed that a non-disclosure agreement prevented him from taking photos or videos. During this time, he started calling me nightly to check in on me. He requested a favor, asking me to assist with a site reconnaissance for a BTO project called Bishan Ridges, as part of a private crowdfunding initiative he was involved in. Considering my proximity to the location, I agreed to help. As a gesture of gratitude, Ivan sent me a picture claiming to have bought me a Tiffany & Co necklace from Taiwan. Shortly after, he shared the news that his boss was pleased with our relationship and had secured me a spot on a private crowdfunding website operated by Guoco Land: https://www.guocopvtpsg23.com. He guided me through the account setup process and provided instructions on how to view investments and projects.

Initially hesitant, I eventually succumbed to emotional blackmail when Ivan exploited my vulnerabilities and cast doubts on government projects, pressuring me to transfer an initial amount of $500. However, after taking some time to cool down and think logically, I decided to investigate further. To my relief, I discovered reports of similar investment scams matching the scheme Ivan had presented to me. Realizing I had been deceived, I played along, feigning interest in investing more. Fortunately, I managed to retrieve my initial deposit and the supposed ""profits.""

Over the next few weeks, she consistently replied to my messages promptly and often asked what I was doing. Our conversations eventually led to me asking her out for a meal, but she declined on multiple occasions. Throughout our conversations, she frequently talked about how she was making extra money through online orders. Gradually, she started asking me to help her with these orders because they were becoming overwhelming.

They shared their registered company, HOME PRO PTE LTD, on Companies SG as a means to ""verify"" their legitimacy.
Yuki explained the workflow, which involved me submitting orders through their system. They offered to provide a tutorial for registering a working account in their system.

On Monday morning, this person called me on WhatsApp and requested my assistance in updating her new contact information on the POSB app. After guiding her through the process, she informed me that she had an urgent payment to make to her contractor.

Anonymous , 07 Jun 2023,Internet Love Scam,"I met Joshua Tan (Chen Yi Da, DOB: 28/10/1990) on CMB app this year. We then moved the conversation to WhatsApp, and he sent me a video deleting the dating apps to prove he was looking for a serious relationship and urged me to do the same.

Joshua is a cybersecurity professional who shared daily photos of food and activities, despite my request for him not to. One day, he mentioned a work trip to Indonesia to resolve a client's database issue. We continued chatting for 2-3 weeks, during which he mentioned Guocoland/Guoco Group/Hong Leong Group.

Despite never meeting in person, I trusted Joshua due to our daily phone calls and his positive words, thoughts, and attitude. I fell into this trap.

Being overseas, Joshua asked for help checking the BTO status in Singapore to decide whether to invest in private crowdfunding or not. He emphasized the need for secrecy, as revealing the investment could cost him his job.

Out of goodwill, I went to the BTO site near my area. Later, Joshua claimed to have successfully invested in the BTO and said he owed me a big favor. I declined, but he insisted it was difficult to join the ""investment platform"" and used his favor to get me an account, urging me to cherish the opportunity. He then started explaining the investment procedures.

The process began with an initial investment of $500, which yielded a $60 return in 2 hours. After three ""small investments,"" he advised me to top up funds to upgrade to a ""silver member"" and become a permanent member of the platform. I rejected this idea, feeling uneasy about how easy the money seemed to be earned. However, Joshua continued to persuade me, claiming it was a big chance for our better future.

Once again, I trusted him, and when I didn't have enough money, he topped up my investment. In the end, I had invested a total of $82,000 of my hard-earned money. When I attempted to make withdrawals, my account was frozen due to allegedly inputting the wrong password. To unfreeze it, I was required to pay $40,000 as a security fund within 48 hours. When I questioned Joshua about this, he deflected blame onto me for not informing him about the incorrect passwords, stating it was my problem, not the platform's. (I had entered the wrong password three times in a row, but was it really wrong all three times?)

Feeling deceived, I realized it was a scam. Joshua claimed he would try to raise $40,000 for me but also suggested I seek loans from banks, private lenders, or friends. He added, ""If you don't want to settle, then it's okay. I'll try to help you.""

After two months, I came across an article about Joshua. If only I had seen it two months earlier, none of this would have happened. Thus, I decided to share my experience to warn everyone.

Afterward, they added me on WhatsApp. Within two days of chatting, they shared how much they could confide in me and expressed a desire to be in a relationship with me. They mentioned feeling unwell and requested my assistance in fulfilling some orders for their part-time job.

This ""part-time job"" involved placing orders for Louis Vuitton products as part of a sales campaign. They claimed that a third-party merchant would reimburse me the principal amount plus a commission for any orders placed, with no physical delivery of the products. Although I voiced my suspicions about the scheme, they assured me that this was a common practice in e-commerce to artificially boost their sales figures.

Subsequently, a ""Louis Vuitton Customer Service"" WhatsApp account approached me to place an order on behalf of the person. The first task involved clicking on a product link and sending a payment of $95 to a PayNow number.

Knowing that this was clearly a scam due to multiple red flags (such as the unrealistically high commission, a multinational company resorting to inappropriate means, and payment to a Singaporean PayNow account for a luxury brand), tactics I had read about frequently on Straitstimes/Mothership, I anticipated that the scammer would increase the value of the tasks and commissions in an attempt to exploit my greed, starting with the $10 commission as a hook.

Deciding to play along with the scammer, I used my phone to alter an image of a previous PayNow transaction record and sent it to the scammer (please note that I never sent any actual payment). The scammer acknowledged my ""payment"" and sent over the rebate and commission. However, they later realized their mistake after verifying the details.

Anonymous , 19 Apr 2023,Job Scam,"A few days ago, a user contacted me on Instagram claiming to be new to Singapore and looking to make friends. Initially, it seemed like a harmless request, but I soon discovered that this was a sophisticated scam.

The scam involved sharing bank details for fraudulent transactions involving Burberry bags, with a promise that the money would be returned to the victim with 0.5% interest. Fortunately, I did not lose any money in this scam.

The scammer lured victims with promises of a meetup and then initiated the fraudulent transactions on the eve of the scheduled meeting. Additionally, the scam involved sending a WhatsApp message to a specified number to obtain the transaction code.

It is important to note that this scam is targeted towards individuals who make public posts on Instagram, and the scammer typically poses as an attractive influencer looking to befriend the victim.

In conclusion, it is crucial to be vigilant and cautious when interacting with strangers on social media, particularly when it involves sharing sensitive information such as bank details.

Anonymous , 21 Mar 2023,Cyber Extortion Scam,"I received an email on 20 March 2023 from my own email account (full content below). Apparently, that person claims that he/she has taken over full control of my computer device and E-mail account and attempted to extort money from me. he/she claimed that with the help of trojan virus, he/she could activate my computer camera and microphone without me noticing and uses that as a threat to expose videos of me if I do not deposit bitcoins into his wallet.

Full email below:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello!
Have you recently noticed that I have e-mailed you from your account?
Yes, this simply means that I have total access to your device.

For the last couple of months, I have been watching you.
Still wondering how is that possible? Well, you have been infected with malware originating from an adult website that you visited. You may not be familiar with this, but I will try explaining it to you.

With help of the Trojan Virus, I have complete access to a PC or any other device.
This simply means I can see you at any time I wish to on your screen by simply turning on your camera and microphone, without you even noticing it. In addition, I have also got access to your contacts list and all your correspondence.

You may be asking yourself, ""But my PC has an active antivirus, how is this even possible? Why didn't I receive any notification?"" Well, the answer is simple: my malware uses drivers, where I update the signatures every four hours, making it undetectable, and hence keeping your antivirus silent.

I have a video of you wanking on the left screen, and on the right screen - the video you were watching while masturbating.
Wondering how bad could this get? With just a single click of my mouse, this video can be sent to all your social networks, and e-mail contacts.
I can also share access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.

All you have to do to prevent this from happening is - transfer bitcoins worth $1450 (USD) to my Bitcoin address (if you have no idea how to do this, you can open your browser and simply search: ""Buy Bitcoin"").

My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 18cZdbWnhjRcUPGZgjRgsXFzLDwYHX7EuA

After receiving a confirmation of your payment, I will delete the video right away, and that's it, you will never hear from me again.
You have 2 days (48 hours) to complete this transaction.
Once you open this e-mail, I will receive a notification, and my timer will start ticking.

Any attempt to file a complaint will not result in anything, since this e-mail cannot be traced back, same as my bitcoin id.
I have been working on this for a very long time by now; I do not give any chance for a mistake.

If, by any chance I find out that you have shared this message with anybody else, I will broadcast your video as mentioned above.",Name: User sent email victim's own account,Contact:,

Unfortunately, I fell victim to one of these surveys in February 2023 without much thought, and after receiving $6 via PayNow, I was led to add someone on Telegram to carry out what others had also fallen prey to. The job tasks required me to like TikTok or YouTube videos for payment per task, and group tasks came along that required me to transfer more and more funds to get returns.
Halfway through the tasks, by clicking on a dubious crypto website they created, they claimed that someone made a mistake when carrying out the tasks and needed to transfer more funds. When I finally had no money to transfer, they claimed that since I could not complete the tasks, the ""mission"" failed, and I could not withdraw the funds.

Anonymous , 09 Feb 2023,Investment Scam,"It all started with a random following on Instagram, with no mutual friends, and i could tell that the instagram was newly created, looking at the date on every post. the person would then say that she/he followed you via 'suggested friends' if you do follow him/her back. after a casual chat, he/she would start to ask you for your mobile number to continue the conversation on Whatsapp/telegram or other social platforms. he/she will start using conversation techniques to keep you engaged in the conversation without you realising you have been hooked. he/she would start sending you pictures of ""themselves"" to make you believe that they are legitimate people.

They will then start to introduce you to business platforms whereby you would earn commission of 5% for every transaction or similar, and would either ask you to join, or help him/her with their daily quota. the moment he/she introduced the business platform, i searched it up on the internet and found numerous scams related cases involving the business platform he/she introduced. luckily, i did not do any transaction and was able to detect their techniques that were used on me and reported them on the social platform (i hope the reporting works).",Name: Luisa Via Roma,Contact: 84120884,

Anonymous , 07 Feb 2023,Job Scam,"between November to December 2022, I've matched with someone named ""Sherene"" (a.k.a. Lok Qiao) via Tinder. The Tinder Profile was verified. She also has an Instagram account that goes by the handle of @lokqiao_lim625.

SHE CLAIMED THAT SHE originates from MELAKA, MALAYSIA, HAVING TWO JOBS IN SG - ONE AS A RETAILER AND THE OTHER A SIDE HUSTLE WITH ""MYTHERESA"".

We exchanged numbers and chatted on WhatsApp. The interaction felt believable. During work hours, she wasn't as responsive to my texts, but only past work hours was she more responsive. She would usually send what she eats for breakfast, lunch and dinner and asked me to do the same to her.

We have been chatty since (although I do not reveal much details about myself, of career and whatnot) for 6 days. I've asked her out thrice in between before we agreed on a date (that's already a red flag).

At the sixth day, she asked me to do a favour, that is to make some orders from a supposed business number named as ""mytheresa.singapore"" (the business number is +65 8937 7624). That is where it didn't add up for me, as I understand that e-commerce sites like mytheresa wouldn't facilitate orders in business numbers like that. As Sherene got hasty with me not replying anything about the orders, I proceeded to block her.

I've seen similar reports at Scam alert, with one report involving someone named Sherene. The reports stated that it took 3 days before the scammer tries to ask for a favour, while for me, 6 days!

Even though I didn't spend a cent on her, I was robbed of my time. My takeaways are as follows:

- scammers have been improving their craft to lure people in for their pockets. Be vigilant in talking to strangers online.
- never reveal too much about yourself with anyone whom you've never met personally. limit the info you share to whom.
- never do favours for someone whom you're not seen ever with your naked eyes
- just because a tinder profile is verified, does not mean you do not need to tread with caution. Be cautious with any of your matches.
- if you have to ask someone out thrice, then that would not seem right
- e-commerce stores do not facilitate orders through a WhatsApp business number.
- if you come across a match who claims to do ""mytheresa"" as a side hustle, then run.",Name: Sherene (Lok Qiao),Contact:,
Anonymous , 06 Feb 2023,Phishing Scam,"My father was the victim of the scam. He's an elderly pioneer generation who is on the internet daily. A pop-up informing him that his microsoft account was compromised and he needs to call a number, which he did! The call connected him to the scammer who claimed that he was from Microsoft cybersecurity team. The scammer asked him to follow some steps to help them diagnose the issue - these steps essentially gave them control of the laptop and restricted movement on his end (he said that the screen felt locked). From there the scammer could see emails and mentioned that they could see his grandchildren's names. Then the scammer said that they will prevent the hacker from hacking into his computer which could happen in the next hour. The scammer asked him if he had $15,000 and they asked him for his bank account number. He gave them a debit card number of a UOB joint account held by parents my father and mother and told them he did not hold the account. He said he will need to withdraw money from a posb account. The scammer told him to withdraw the money and deposit it into the UOB account. ](note: the whole time my mother said that this was a scam and to call the police but my father kept engaging the scammer). The scammer called again after a few minutes to ask if he have withdrawn the money. The scammer told him he can take a taxi to UOB and they would reimburse the taxi fare! He actually went to POSB to draw the $15,000 but my mother held on to the money. At which point my mother called me, and she refused to let him have the cash. I told them that this was a classic scam, stop engaging the scammer and to report to the police. They lodged a police report. My mother then called uob who froze their account immediately. The police took down their report, and with that presented it to uob. We needed to freeze and close the account, create a new one.

1) asked for his namecard and company name
- he told he don't carry one and could not find his namecard
- Provided company name 'TZ new media'. No such company registered in singapore and there is no trace of digital footprints on website

2) when he ask about where are you and why never ask him along
- offer to allow him to join in, but he will never dare to show up. Telling you that he afraid you will be shy.

3) in CMB app, he will remove the chat with you. So you cannot trace his profile and report him in CMB directly.

3) HOW MUCH WAS LOST: SGD 24805

job scam summary
it all started from a WhatsApp message sent to me to answer a very simple survey on singapore and yourself. after answering the survey on whatsapp, she told me to contact her receptionist via telegram IF I WERE INTERESTED to learn MORE JOB OPPORTUNITY. on telegram, the receptionist asked me for my personal details (name, Gender, Age, Nationality, WhatsAPP no., Occupation) and THEN INTRODUCED ME THE work/mission WAS TO like youtube videos and share screenshot of the like to a telegroup. day 1, the work was easy and seeing actual money flowing into my bank had me convinced that they are trustable. on my day 2, i participated in a rare mission named prepaid activities. in this mission, i was added to telegroup chat named ""task group"" with a supervisor and another 3 more members. this mission required us to create an account on a not secured currency exchange website and pool in money to a middleman for funds to do the exchange on the website. it takes several rounds to complete the pooling of money and the basic money to pool in just kept increasing. wanting to back out but i was too deep in so i continued to transfer. $529 > $1566 > $4998 > $16885 however, when i thought it was finally completed, i was told that my transaction had failed and i would have to put in another $50655 to get back what i failed. when i told them these were all i have and i really have no choice but to withdraw, they kept convincing me to ask around for help. THE RECEPTIONIST MANAGED TO GATHER 15K and a kind soul from the same task group chat offered to help to cover whatever i was left with. i was elated and transferred my last bit of money to the middle man. *declined* i received a call from the bank and was told that i have been transferring money to accounts from another bank that are already marked as scam.

Reflection on the red flags that i should have noticed:-

- people in the group chat are too happy to welcome the prepaid task
- their words did not match e.g some people mentioned the prepaid task is rare but being in the group chat for 2 days, i already seen such activity 3 times.
- too easy money
- ""force me"" to transfer money within a short time frame
- ""kind soul"" who was too nice to borrow me, a stranger, 30k
- many different middleman accounts to transfer
- my output was more than what i earned from them (should have realize at this point this is not a job)",Name: youtube group activity 300,Contact:,

2) it happened just last week during.

3) i lost a total of $14,000 sgd.

Brief summary
a sms was sent to phone saying that it will pay a commission ($6) to answer a simple survey on singapore attractions. I felt is was a simple request and responded to the message. Following the answer, the person referred me to a colleague who will pay out the commission. The colleague then asked for my name age and number to pay out the commission. She then asked me if i was interested to earn more commissions by liking youtube videos by sending screenshots on telegram which i agreed to, i then earned some commissions. Subsequently, the colleague referred me to search for @judy6655 and her on telegram for the mission (task) to be completed. (judy) then asked if i am interested to complete some tasks to earn more commissions. I agreed and was asked to create an account on a link (fddf1.com) she gave. The website was used to purchase cryptocurrency. (judy) assured me that her colleague (kennedy) would guide us to make the investment and the returns would double. Upon completion of the first 2 tasks, the commissions were payed back to my bank account to gain my trust that the platform was legitimate. It even had the name of the person who transferred the monies. On 6 jan 2023, (kennedy) then texted me on telegram. He gave me another link (562oz.com) and gave specific instructions to purchase on the website which i followed. In order to withdraw the money earned in the transaction, i would have to top up money into the account. I would have to transfer money to (kennedy) through (judy) so that the money will be credited to my account on the website. I then transferred and followed the instructions to them and kennedy kept on asking me to top up more money as someone in the group made an error.

On 17 Dec, got a whatsapp message from this number enquiring how to change the otp using the posb bank app. (this seems like a trivial task for my friend which I believe he would know how to do) hence I called my friend's old number to verify the details with him and I got to know he did not lose his phone at all.

I also used mobile phone reverse search to find out which provider and owner of that number was and there wasn't any name linked to the phone number, which made it more suspicious because if you were to try out a few of your friend's number it would show up their name.

I immediately told her that i wasn't going to help her and she stopped replying to me, which is obvious enough that it is a scam sign.

Would like to warn people not to believe such job offers or helped an online friend to carry out jobs. Especially just knowing a date for 3 days and asking to help her purchase things without meeting them in the first place is huge risk involved as scammer would always try avoid meeting you in person.

If your online date ask for money, you must know it is never a good thing, there are options like a license moneylender or a bank, they can lend them money or if they ask you want to earn good money with commission through online it is alway a scam, no official business will ever do trading online using internet banking. The scammer can also use a business number to do scams, so it make them look legit. This is what i learn after getting scam half way. The scammer have many banking accounts to spare so they will not get flag out, they don't use posb/dbs as the bank will flag out accounts that are reported as scam. They are alway trying to help you, listen to them.

The rule is very simple for everyone to follow:

1) if they claim they are from a company look up the company and ask/message them is there such a thing. There is no harm in asking, asking is free.

2) you can alway questions the people you are dealing with by asking more details of the things that you are required to do, they will explain it but never in full details so just ask them, if they got triggered by what you ask them you must know this is a red-flagged, stop what you are doing.

3) you can make friend with people online by as long as it involves money stay away from them, it is not worth to throw your money to people like them.

4) if you think you are half way into the scam immediately either export all the messages from the chat to save as evidence or screen record the chat. You will need it when you do police report. Evidence is very important for investigation.

Anonymous , 06 Oct 2022,Job Scam,"A girl @aisyah_angel_5534 suddenly followed me on instagram. Her intro, post and followers looks normal so i accepted. We started chat and then our chat was directed to whatsapp (+6581737314). We turned out to have similar background.

She even sent me her own pic, the food she was eating and working pic. She works as a store manager in a skincare company at orchard during daytime and works part-time for chanel to create data to boost sales.

After some days, she said she couldn't sleep well and her eyes are pain. Asked me to help her completing some of her part-time job task so she can sleep earlier. I agreed.

She sent me a whatsapp no. (+6591336261), said is 'chanel online customer service' and asked me message them saying i am helping her. They started sending me the 'task'. First, a real chanel product link was sent. I was asked to take a screenshot for them to confirm. Later they sent an accout number and mobile no. (which belongs to some weird malay name) for me to transfer/paynow.

First order $90, i sent and after a while, returned $105 ($10 newcomer bonus + 5% of product price). Second order $530, i sent and returned $556. They wrote that completed 3 orders has $50 bonus (clearly, first two are the bait). Third order, amount started to become 5k+ (the real deal comes). The girl was still sharing her experience to make it convincing, like orders more than 5k are rare and i was lucky etc. She got a 9k order previously and got nice bonus.

5k+ was too much. She said can ask for changing. They changed to a 3k product. I just transfer but didnt notice the order quantity this time is '3'!! I was asked to pay for the remaining two. I was so shocked and asked her for rescue. She said is ok to pay in ringgit too. They then sent me a malaysia bank account to transfer. Luckily bank blocked the transaction.

I later tried to pay partial but the sg bank declined it and called me saying it is actually a job scam. I told her and she still tried to convince me by sharing she had similar experiences, told me not to worry. She 'helped' me to pay partial and showed me the screenshot. Think i am too eager to get back my money (the sunk cost) so i stupidly transfer another 1k to 'keep' the order. Part of me even felt guilty like i really owed her money.

There is a fine line between kindness and stupidity. I feel so embarrassed, my intention was just to help a 'friend'. She still said that i am a good guy. How sarcastic! Sharing this to remind all of you to stay vigilant and not falling into the same trap. Found some similar stories here also (but seems i am the only stupid one).

I asked for their credentials and linda reply ""food & beverage international holdings pte. Ltd. (registration id: 200718722c)"". Since i indicated interest, linda said that a colleague will be contacting me for more details and that i can decline in the end. Then linda became a deleted account.

The 'next' person contacts me on telegram, moomnchloe (username: @chloee_ly) and further explains the job. Her profile pic is with her 'family', looks normal.
Job scope was to view images of a dish and rate it 1-5 stars on their website, each dish will indicate the commission that will be received after 32 evaluations done. Did 32 reviews, put in my paynow number and they do send the indicated commission amt (~$14) to my bank. All seems good.

Then the scam thickens, to continue with the next set of 32 reviews, chloe says need to do a ""renewal"", which requires a deposit of $120 to ""customer service"" to create ""consumption data"". Doing this allows you to continue the reviews and gain commission. They promise a renewal bonus everytime you do this. Also, every set of 32 evaluations are said to be $30-40 now.

Chloe invites me to a telegram grp of fellow food evaluators (14 ppl), seems v friendly at first with ppl welcoming you and they share random videos. Then someone in the grp asks how to do the 33rd food evaluation and someone replies saying that need to deposit the $120...(same info as what chloe told me). The person is doubtful and asks for more info, all of which is answered by other ppl in the grp. At the same time, chloe also private msg me to ask if i have any issue with the renewal. After i stop replying, another person in the group chat says that he has renewed and sends a screenshot of his commission gains (with ""success"" indicated beside each transaction).

Before they could “release” the loan to me, they said i needed to pay an active account charge, and another charge, which totals to 1,500 sgd each (3,000 sgd both). After paying both charges, they took an hour to forge a document that has an mas logo, saying that the money is held by mas and i needed to pay another 3,000 sgd for the release of the loan money.

1) Avoid any incoming calls starting with +65
2) Even if you have picked up such incoming calls & the caller is introducing himself from any loan company, pls end the call. Be prepared that they will continue to text you. You will need to be firm by ignoring them or blocking many unknown incoming phone numbers.
3) Suspect all these callers have access to the borrower's personal information from the staffs of legal money lenders or financial institutions. They claimed to know where is your residence which is accurate. how can they have access to obtain your residential address????
4) If you ever noticed, when u are financially stable, u only received calls from financial institutions eg. applying for credit cards, personal loans or balance transfer etc. But once you have reached your financial turbulence, you may start to receive such calls starting with +65.

After the whole incident i discovered he misused another fb user photos impersonating as him to commit scams. The business acct number on whatsapp he lured me into was “mytheresa online cs” (88078289) and the website link given to identify the products for payment was legit (mytheresa website). But were asked to transfer directly to payee (“merchant”) via internet transfer or Paynow (88240548). Basically it’s the same about paying first, commission & principal sum will be refunded after each transaction. There will be excuses such as account freezing, recharging account to request for more money, very fast it increased fr 3 digits to 5 digits. I regretted for not stopping immediately when i realize things were amiss, i was still hoping there is still some hope in getting back all my money. For first transaction, eric “bank in” money and told me to send the receipt to customer service for verification. After that, cs will request me for bank details to refund. Eric told me his account is already tied to his membership acct and for me to help him obtain back the refund. I didn’t think much at first, proceeded and it is obviously a scam or lie. After mentioning you have no more money left, he will tell you that he can help you top-up a portion first ($14k), the rest you need to think of solution, eg loaning from friends family. They are very well versed with bank operations, eg UOB daily Paynow transfer only restrict to 5k, you need to transfer all your money out to other banks or POSB to make transfers. For big amount they may even ask you to spilt into 2 transactions, eg: 10k +7k. Then when daily transfer limit is low, they will tell you go to manage setting raised your daily limit to 100k. They will mention that adding payee requires 12 hr to take effect so best is to transfer payment out using POSB account.

Frankly, I myself don’t even know all these. They are very experienced scammers. Moral of story is, do not be greedy. There is no such thing as easy money. I lost nearly 62k in 3 hrs!

Anonymous , 29 Aug 2022,Job Scam,"Chatted with the person for quite some time and got introduced to how she was making quick money by fulfilling orders on the site luisaviaroma.

Basically the scam goes like this
1. They provide you with a link to the product and asks you to transfer the amount to a given bank account (money mule). The given bank account names are both malay name based on what I've experienced so far.
2. They start of with products that costs < $100 to bait you into thinking its a good deal
3. You make the payment and get the initial sum refunded plus a 5% commission.
4. Slowly the items get more and more expensive and the conditions suddenly changes from 1 quantity to 3 quantity and they request that you make that payment twice.

I did not notice the change and only make the transfer for 1 item. They then contacted me that I'll have to make the payment for the other 2 items (Which i did, thinking that I'll get back my money).
Then later they told me that I'll have to repeat the process again as it was a double order.

It was then did i realised that I've been in a scam all along.

When confronted, scammer would make all sorts of excuses to get you to pay that balance amount. Even to the extend of offering to pay up to 10k of the balance amount).

The final straw was when I made the full amount, they say my account got frozen and need to unfreeze by doing another order task which is $8500. at this point of time, i realize that i was caught in a scam. I quickly make a police report when i confirm with my other friends.

I suspect this is an organised group doing these catfishing to cheat money from people. i suspect it could either local or Malaysians or even mainland Chinese as their transaction is all on paynow and the names of the account are mostly Malay and chinese.",Name: the person name is luna and the group is Dior singapore,Contact: 89273307,

I asked him for his name since the no. is not registered and he said, ""aiyo, you cannot recognize my voice meh, you make a guess"". so I asked if he is XXX and he said yes. he then went on to tell me that this is his new hp no. and asked that I erased the old no. and replaced with the new number. he told me he lost his HP and wallet so he's calling to inform of the change in no. he proceeded to ask if AM free this Sat as he started a cafe with his friend at Northpoint and wants to invite us to the opening.

1. if anyone called and asked you to guess, don't do it. By doing so, we gave him an identity to assume.
2. whenever in doubt, call up the person to verify and don't simply erase the old no.

His Whatsapp number +447868693687 and +447883183162 (business account but lost his phone). We chatted about 1.5 month starting june.

similar to other stories here, he moved to Glasgow since young after his dad passing, consultant engineer and entrepreneur, shared soapy stories about how he got cheated by ex gf, talked about future with you, going to marry you, showed love and care everyday without fail, shared his photos with his mom and videos/selfies regularly, also shared photos of his daily life etc.

The most ridiculous part was he lost his passport and wallet during his business trip in Istanbul and asked me to wire him $2k in order for him to survive. I told him I couldn't transfer money internationally then he found his ways to ask me to wire to some contacts in sg then they could wire the money to him. He even showed me the police report to prove that he really lost his passport. I've done my research and found out that isn't right with the passport number. Uk passport number only comprises 9 digits but in his police report shows 10 digits.

Just like other victims here, he also ""send"" gifts to me, only 2 weeks later i received a WhatsApp message to pay $4850 for the delivery and clearance fees. So i've again confirmed it's a scam and probably it is running by a group of ppl behind.

ads showing shopee/lazada app logos
language used: english/chinese
time flexibility (can be done from home in mobile/computer platforms)

clicked to learn more about as I do want to earn some additional cash as a side hustle. the contact person would then whatsapp you to do some sort of mini interview asking for your age (do keep in mind that they apparently have an age requirement). then the person would introduce about the company as per following in summary (which I suspect that they are using a real company as a disguise)

our company workday is founded in 2005 and registered in Singapore at 2015. it is a leading enterprise integration platform that automates product data. main job is to help sellers create complete data products (aka product reviews). system would generate 40 data for us to create and we have complete 40 data . (these information provided from them are legit company, there is an uen number for tracking and status is ""live"" but technically speaking at a later point I find that these business information can be bought from acra website at $5.50 and they could re-use the format and amend the contact person details and save it as a pdf to make it look legit)

2 sets of account would be used in this case. one will be your own and the other is from the person who contact you. there would be a guidance phase where you will be given 40 data to update your ""product reviews"" and there would be a chance for you to get 3x commission if you are lucky and each time u encounter the 3x commission, your balance would become negative and you are require to top up the negative amount. all this will be done from the contact person's account first and after 3 tries, you would be using your own account.

now here comes the trap, as you are doing the 40 sets of data from your own account. you will encounter more 3x commission than usual. meaning your negative balance would keep on increasing and increasing to the point you are very cash tight. after that I kind of just went mia on them as I felt something is amiss.

The page will prompt you to pay a small amount of money that you think is negligible ($2.80). But you have to key in your credit card details.

A red flag was that it was asking for shipping customs duties and taxes at all. Singaporeans know you only pay customs if you buy more than $400.

Another red flag was the website URL was nothing related to singpost —despite the site using the Singpost logo (which can be easily copied from online) — which is suspect BC official Singpost would have a legitimate website URL.

So, I went to search the Singpost website, and found if you do need to pay customs for Singpost you can only do it on their Singpost app or at a Sam machine —anything else asking you to pay online or through an SMS is fake / a scam.

I was skeptical but they assured me its legit and encourage me to renew in order to complete another set of 35 hotel ratings.

So I embarked on my second set of rating. At the 17th ratings , i was given a deluxe package which is 5x the commission I thought I was lucky. However, the system did not allow me to continue and my deposit become negative. I asked the admin and was explained that it is a system assign bonus, in order to continue i need to deposit more money to the froze account and I deposited $400 to continue. at the 25th rating I have another deluxe package and my deposit became negative, admin again explained i need to deposit $600 to continue, and i did. again at the 32th rating I was given another deluxe package, same thing my DEPOSITs become negative and was told to deposit another 2.5k.

I was suspicious at first but the scammer reassured me by sending me a picture of her IC.

After depositing the $118, I continued rating hotels but before I was able to withdraw my money, I got a ""luxury hotel"" which meant that I could earn more commission but had to deposit more money to offset my negative account balance. they prompted me to transfer another $364 and I foolishly did so. Within minutes, I got another ""luxury hotel"" and this time I had to transfer $723 and I almost did so but luckily I was stopped by my Paynow transfer limit and did not manage to transfer the amount in the end. About an hour later, I came across an internet article which had a scam scheme that was almost identical to mine and that was when I realised I got scammed.

The person was able to address my daughter by her name and informed her that her I/C was used to issue a credit card which was sent to an address in Bukit Timah. There was a payment of almost $10,000 due tomorrow. She started to panic and at that point, she was transferred to a 'police officer'. At that point, she came to me and gave me the phone and i spoke to that 'officer'.

He asked me to come down to the cantonment branch to make a report and when i asked if i can make a report in my neighbourhood police post, he agreed. After the call, when i spoke to my daughter, i realised it was a +65 number and so could be a spam call.

Anonymous , 03 Jun 2022,Job Scam,"I was contacted on telegram with a job offer (28/12/21). Soon after, I was contacted on WhatsApp and provided with a website detailing the company and a job portal.
Two accounts were created, the first being one for my own use, the second by the person whom I was speaking to. After topping-up the second account, they directed me to complete the tasks to generate data. By example, there was a need to top up the account every time it reached a negative amount. She would top up the account by direct me to contact customer service with the top-up details.
Upon completing the tasks, she withdrew the amount from the account and sent the amount to the first account that had been made for my own use. I was then directed to complete the tasks on the account where I proceeded to do the same and successfully withdrew a portion of the money. (28/12/21).

The next day (29/12/21), the same person contacted me. Following the same steps, I completed the steps on her account first.

Things started getting worse when I started using my own account. The amounts kept getting bigger and when I consulted the person about these amounts, she continued to encourage me to keep going so that I could withdraw the full amount once the tasks were complete.

I contacted customer service and questioned them, stating that if I did not get the money back, I would lodge a police report. They replied that they had an army of lawyers that would counter the claims. After some back and forth, I was told that a manager would be calling me.

During the call, their manager requested we top up a final amount to off-set the negative on the account so that the order could be completed. Including the amount that was supposed to be deposited, I was supposed to receive the total plus commission once the transfer was complete. I agreed to this after requesting some details as assurance from the manager.

Once I had fulfilled the top-up, I waited before going to check the status of the account. This was when the manager called me again, yelling at me to ask me what I did, only to find that there was now a new order on the account and that the negative amount on the account was back even larger than the last. They claimed that this had never happened before and said that I had done something. I did not even have my phone with me because I had it on the charger at the time the transaction was made.
I noticed a HP advertisement on their website earlier which is why I thought the company had some legitimacy to it.

They claimed that this is done to protect the privacy of users, so the website address will keep changing. In order to do the job, you have to invest a small amount at first, $115, to start.

The job is to rate food reviews & a total of 33 evaluations. After 1st round, it was easy & the merchant paid a commission to me of $11.

The Story was quite convincing because not only does this person know my name and phone number, she knows my email address too. (I asked for her to prove that she was really from lazada.)

What didn't make sense to me was that it was not my bank that called me to verify the transaction. I mean, if someone used my Lazada account and paid for the item him/herself, well... go ahead. no loss to me. i'd just need to update my password or something, and yes, of course worry about this person having access to my Home address as well. I checked my app to see if there was any recent new order made, but there was nothing. On hindsight, I've had problems transacting on Lazada when I'm on VPN, so the app is advanced enough to detect if there is any strange traffic (and not let the transaction go through).

the lady on the other line asked me for the 6-digit OTP, which of course was a surefire sign that it was a scam call. It really helped that Lazada included the following message in their text: Lazada: NEVER SHARE YOUR OTP. LAZADA will not request OTP from customers. That, and a quick google search, really helped me confirm that this call is not legitimate at all.

Back to eve k, she explained that the next reviews + commission can only proceed if I deposit a minimum of $110 as well.

i gave excuses that I have no money etc, and initiated to return the commission of $11.38 as I can't participate anymore. she said I don't have to return, then, I left the telegram group. so far no one there contacted me except eve k, even though we have already ended the conversation the day prior.

Anonymous , 16 May 2022,Job Scam,"I got scammed. It is about a job where you do reviews for different cuisines, and for every 28-31 cuisines you reviewed, you will get a commission of $16. However, after the 28-31 times, you have to top-up, I think, $112 to continue.
After that, I would get a 'special delicacy ' that would require me to top-up hundreds or thousands, and I would get 5 times the commission . I'm on my 27th review, and i'm not sure if there's one more or 6 more . I was first contacted on telegram then referred to someone on whatsapp . The group consists of 14 people. In my case one of the new mwmbers reached out to me and she got her money back . But when i tried to, the money i had to deposit was not only once but was getting bigger and bigger .

Anonymous , 16 May 2022,Job Scam,"I was contacted by a recruiter from ""BGC Group"" called Julie and she referred me to the job in-Charge known as ChongLin.

Chonglin then introduced to me that the job was to boost sellers' listings just by clicking 2 buttons. The job involves completing 45 sets of lisitings and I will receive commission for each listing I have completed. The listings are categorized into 2 types: normal and enterprise. Normal does not require deposits while Enterprise requires deposits. At first, when an enterprise data pops up, chonglin will lead by asking me to contact the customer service whatsapp account to request for a bank account to deposit money. He also explained that I could take out my principal on top of my commissions. Afterwards, he even showed a screenshot of his transaction to gain my trust.

The next day when I tried, there were much more enterprise lisitings. Each listings requires more and more money to deposit in order to complete the lisiting. Being led on by chonglin, i did not doubt much and continued to deposit until I realise I do not have sufficient funds to do so. Thats when I asked from help and they asked me to borrow from my friends and family. Its was only when I told my sister and I found out it was a scam. I lost about 11k at this point. I reported to the bank and police later on in the same day.

Here are some of the key takeaways from my incident:
1) Do not trust any online messages claiming to be a recruiter
2) There should always be company funds to perform business operations. So even if the party seems reliable and convincing, do not trust him/her to make deposits
3) Just because there is a group chat for your work, means your job us real. Though not mention above, I was being added to a whatsapp group chat. I believed their tactics to make you think it is legitimate. They also purposefully gain your trust by having other scammers acting as newbies to ask questions you would be interested in to gain your trust.
4) It is obvious that it is a scammer organization, with one loop after another to get you trapped in this scam.
5) Always question everything you see online, no matter how reliable it may seem.
6) When you find it suspicious, always trust ur instinct, stop what you are doing and verify. Do not be led on by the scammers.

I hope my painful lesson will help to spread awareness and prevent less people from falling prey to such scams again. :)",Name: Scammer: Chonglin / company: microstrategy,Contact: 89156147,

1) why is our conversation in Mandarin? Is this MOH’s protocol to converse and introduce yourself in Mandarin?
2) Since when MOH hire Taiwanese as call operator?
3) I replied how come that phone number that receive complain, i’m not aware that i have this additional number under my name?

He sound very pissed, so in the end our phone call became arguing session. Before he ended the call, he still threatened to blacklist my number and submit to singapore police force. Ultimate joke of the day.

By the way, some red flags observed from this experience:

1) masked number which called id shown “+65” before a singapore handphone number
2) throughout the conversation are in mandarin
3) totally unprofessional at all. Threatening / easily agitated.

We quickly became friends, and it was nice chatting with her. her story of coming to Singapore from hong kong to do a family business with her dad seemed believable.

Things took a turn when we started talking about crypto. she shared how she made money and that i should consider trying. she would guide me as well. she sent me a link, and told me to register. (please dont click on this link: https://h5.j5f8g3zn.xyz/).

It brought me to a shady crypto exchange, and thankfully i know quite a bit about crypto and used some exchanges before. she said it was a uk-based exchange called ""transact"". the login from the link was different from the ""transact"" uk exchange that i googled. it had some similarities with exchanges, but mainly require real fiat money, instead of any crypto wallets, which had unique wallet addresses.

then she would rush me to top up $500 (it was the minimum amount), and i went to search how to do so. she said use whatsapp to customer service, and the number is +852 6371 6255.

It was really suspicious already. Definitely not the right way to do a transaction on a crypto exchange. she kept asking me if i had recharged already or not, and sent me screenshots of her earning some money. when i asked her about her strategy to buy and sell, she said some really confusing terms, that i have not heard of in technical analysis: ""Because the transaction node is coming soon, we must seize this opportunity. We combine the 24H K-line chart, and judge the rise and fall of the node according to the trend of the Yang line"".

When I expressed more concern, she said it made our relationship weird and blamed me for not trusting her.

When i told her that i wanted to meet her and see how she does it in-person, she changed the topic. even if she stays very near me, she said she don't have time on weekdays. this was extremely suspicious.and after a few hours when I ignored her messages, i realised the chat with her on tinder was already deleted/gone.

i have read some other scam stories where they managed to top up, and really made some money, which caused them to top up more, due to greed. but when the withdrawal comes, they are unable to do it, saying they need to hit a certain amount before withdrawing, and after that the ""customer service"" says withdrawal has some problems etc.

Anonymous , 14 Mar 2022,Job Scam,"Was contacted by Kelly via telegram and claimed she is from “Peoplesearch”. Told her I am looking for weekend part-time jobs and she shared she has something that suits my requirements. She asked for my name and contact number and informed that someone from the hiring company will reach out to me to share more details.

Then on 26 February 2022, a man named Marcus claimed he is from criteo and is hiring to help optimize data content and visibility etc. On the website or third-party mobile platforms to increase traffic and provide revenue stream.

with all questions asked, I registered a profile with criteo http://www.o-criteo.com/ and Marcus taught me how to do the job and withdraw the money. He also added me to this WhatsApp group which he claims is his team which he has built. There was also one guy named ‘Soo heng who joined the group at the same time as me and pm-ed me asking if this job is legit. He was also trying to be friendly. (I am now 100% sure this ‘Soo heng is also their accomplice). This job requires you to complete 43 data sets, but midway you will be prompted to recharge the negative value to complete the job. (they claimed you strike the bonus data and have to recharge the negative value for 3 times to unlock the data and continue the job. The “bonus data” gives higher commission). For the first few attempts, the recharge value was minimal and I was able to complete the first 3 jobs and get paid (along with the amount I recharged).

Things got fishy in late Feb when http://www.o-criteo.com/ got suspended. I checked with the group chat and they shared they are not scam and that the company will constantly upgrade their website to ensure the security of the system. Marcus gave new links to the criteo website - https://www.t-criteo.com/ and https://www.i-criteo.com/ to do the job. I did the last and final job and the recharge value went insanely high from a range of sad 800 to sad 13,000. Which system is so “smart” and “random” and assigns you another bonus data once you finished recharging for the last bonus data? Obviously, it is rigged. That is when I know they are scammers and I already had sad 13,000 locked in their platform.
Marcus and counterparts will say things like ""just a bit more and you can take out all your cash that you recharged.

Met this scammer via tinder who scammed me of via fake cryptocurrency investment (oriental wealth). I invested 100sgd initially and could withdraw with a profit. then he asked to invest 6k, which i did. then he asked me to invest another 30k which i sensed something amiss and i could not withdraw the 6k. after so many weeks, i have not heard back from the police on whether this guy is arrested or if they manage to get back the money i lost.

this is a very common scam called pig butchering scam.

1) claims to be rich/business owner from china, stays in condo in orchard. His tinder location shows newton and less than 1km away from me (i stay near central). these scammers go to such areas just so that their tinder location can reflect location in central and make their ""rich"" story more believable.

2) ask for whatsapp etc. they keep changing their tinder picture with different men picture so after they ask for your contact, they simply unmatch you on tinder.

3) Asked to chat with you in chinese, citing they prefer to chat in chinese outside of work.

4) Profile picture typically looks nice with minimal description/random english quotations/chinese quotations, but some picture looks like they are local singapore as well.

5) they read your dating profile and will get you to reveal more about your interest, religion etc when chatting, assess your character and pretend to be someone your character would like.

6) for my case, the guy was smart because he asked to meet but at his house. as a female of course i said no. then i suggested meeting for a meal and he was dissing the choice of my restaurant - this is just the scammer tactic to avoid meeting face to face.

Some suggestions based on my experience, other than what is stated above

1) check if the guy has instagram, other social media platform, linkedin. surely a normal person have some form or another of such accounts

2) if point 1 fails, or they dont add you, ask for the picture of the guy doing specific action (you dictate), or video call. tinder verified profile MAY not mean that the person is real. i read somewhere that the guy could just get his own photo verified and then change the photo (to a nicer looking guy) afterwards - but i cannot confirm this.

3) look out for fake looking profile, listing that he is a business owner, stays in an exclusive neighbourhood such as newton, orchard, novena, bukit timah, tanglin. especially if these areas are written in chinese in the dating app,",Name: Alden,Contact:,

on our second day of chat, she suddenly felt ready to meet and was agreeable to a date. she also asked if i was busy and could help her with some zalora task. i was not comfortable with the idea, so i rejected her at first and she just expressed slight disappointment. she said she has to complete the tasks in order to be able to go on the date with me the next day.

I gave her a little benefit of doubt and tried to get her to explain to me what the zalora job entails, in which she explained in mandarin. she said she will help me with the payment the first time (to prove to me it is 'real') and subsequently, i can do the rest by myself in which i will earn some commissions.

I sensed something fishy and decided to google search 'zalora tasks' and true enough, there were recounts of such scams in the past 1 year and there were a few people who had already been victims of such scams. i blocked this girl's contact after telling her i refused to help her with this.

Things took a turn when we started talking about crypto, a topic that he broached. I shared that i was new and he sent screenshots of a pledge mining pool. He said it was lucrative and i should consider trying. I was curious and asked for more information. When i told him i needed to do more research, he encouraged me, warning me to only use legitimate platforms

Each day, he would persuade me to invest us$50-$100, to the point where i felt pressured and uncomfortable. Looking online, all that came up was a pledge mining scam video.

Wanting to give him the benefit of the doubt, I told him I had reservations and even sent the link of the video I found. He seemed shocked and tried to assure me that he did research too. He also said that if his investment turned out to be a scam, he would sue, and made a joke about it.
When I expressed more concern, he said it made our relationship weird and blamed me for not trusting him. We even got into an argument.

I tried to change the topic and asked for more info. That’s when he sent me a link which tried to direct me to coinbase. I realised this was a scam and didnt click further. At this point, I spoke to some friends and they asked me proceed with caution.

Coincidentally, I had other things happen that halted our conversation, but not before he sent more screenshots of new investments he had made. He told me he had decided to continue investing despite me previously sharing it could be a scam.

After i have register an account on ecommerce, she asked me to use her account to do the ""clicking stuff"" unitl 60 tasks are done , when it requires top-up, ( balance insufficient), she top up using her account. on 15/1/2022, i actually earn $124. However, the next day, the top up is getting too high and the so called triple commission is going from $199 to $540. I do not have sufficient money in my bank account to continue with the top up. so I messaged her and asked for help. she'll just encourage me to keep going with the money and i actually wanted to transfer another $790. Luckily, DBS blocked the transaction and lock my account. However, The scammer ( +65 88275714), told me that the money is already top up for me.
So i continue with the task, however, after a few tasks , I was required to top up again and is $1160 this time. so i went to ask for help.

i believe that this scam has re-emerged. 
 
+6584123746 this number call me twice, first call i picked up, no sound. I hung up. The same number called again, i pick up again, and this strong malaysian chinese accent guy talk to me, and told me, ""hello , this is my new singapore number 84123746, please remember""

i was like ""ok""? Then could you tell me who you are first? so that i'm able to update my contact right, he said, "" we just meet up recently you forget? from this point i already confirm what he said was fake why he need to hide himself if he is legit? 2nd he is waiting for me to give him a name so that he can carry on his scamming. but too bad i dont have any malaysian friend. i play along with him, i ask him, ok at least you can tell me what your old number? so that i am able to update my contact? he say will whatapp me his old contact for me to update, till now he did not whatapp me anything. before he hang up he say later i whatapp you my old number you update this new number your contact, we can go yishun northpoint for a meal as his friend open a new foodstall there. and he hang up.

3 day later my colleague told me he was scam of 400 dollar. due to this same Modus operandi (MO) he told me he transferred of 400 to this unknown guy he say his new stall need to pay his food supplier first as he just open a new stall. my colleague report this to police already.

Same accent that sounded like Malaysian, same tactic, to use open new stall as reason to transfer money to supplier. Such a coincidence.

Lastly, i would like to use this platform to inform all people with foreign friend. do check the person identity first, ask a secret question that you and your foreign friend will know challenge the caller first. if not, hold the call and immediately your foreign friend if he really change number. before continuing the conversation.

I joined a few job ads group so I thought they randomly messaged us. So I ask for details and soon after a person on WhatsApp message me and invited me to a group. Everyone in there was very friendly and helpful. About 7-8 of them. Some even pumped me and help me along. 1 of them act as new comer and pm me as well. Share me screens and their journey(inciting me to do the same)

it is said that there's a job like ""online ticketing tasks"" (basically purchase movie tickets and earn comms.

So they asked me to register an account from this website jtxszp.com and after that there's a free $100 inside for you to ""start"" purchasing movie tickets and boost the ratings etc. (you need to complete 35 tasks to withdraw your money) to earn comms. So I earned $10 from 35tasks and it was able to withdraw that ""$10"" comms. (so basically they roped you in by giving you $10 first.)

And soon that $10 earned them $491 in return.

So for the 2nd time, there is no more $100 free. So I have to top my own $100 and the story begins. It says you get a premium ticket (no.17 ticket) but you need another $391 to unlock. So I need top up and on the ticket no.21, I got another 'premium' ticket and asked me to top another $1100+. That is when I got suspicious and stopped deposit and went to ask them.

Anonymous , 12 Jan 2022,Phishing Scam,"A buyer named luyang (USERNAME:TANGLUYANG) contacted me on carousell to buy my secondhand clothes ( which cost only $12). Initially, she was asking for some extra information about the clothes and I asked to meetup in person to make the deal. I stay in the east and she stays in the west , so i asked to compromise and told her i could meet around town area. This was when she offered to get a courier service herself to get the items from my house to deliver them to her house. She asked me for my house address, mobile phone number and email address so she could ask the courier to get the items from me. I did not have any second thoughts and gave all my information to her. Then, the nightmare began; She told me that she would transfer $12 to me through PAYNOW with caroupay. I have heard it’s a new in-app feature but have never used it before so I do not know how it works. She sent me multiple screenshots of the payment made to my mobile phone number on PAYNOW and they looked legit. I then received an email on my gmail account with the title: “Caroupay confirmation” and the sender address was [buyandsale.carousell@gmail.com]. The content in the email was:

Dear Customer,

A payment has been made to your paynow no. from luyang through caroupay, kindly complete your login on our carousell website for your funds to be added to your paynow account. Please paste the URL below to your browser: confirmation-proceeds.herokuapp.com [NOTE: Fake website. Do NOT click]

At this point, I somehow knew something was wrong and hesitated to click into the link. However, like people said :curiosity killed the cat. I clicked into the website to see what is going on, and not to my surprise, it was a DBS homepage (with the strange URL above) and it prompt me to enter my ibanking id and password. I closed the webpage immediately and confronted the buyer. She insisted that nothing was wrong and her payment did not get transferred to my account successfully and kept asking me to login to the link sent to my email to get her payment. This was when I blocked her and reported her account to carousell. Even though I did not lose any money in this scamming incident, but I did share personal information such as my home address.

I hope my story acts as a warning for those who are dealing with strange buyers like this on any online platforms and please don’t be like me, who clicked into a suspicious URL link sent to your email.",Name: carousell username:tangluyang,Contact:,

Anonymous , 10 Jan 2022,Job Scam,"I was contacted on telegram by adeline asking if i was looking for a part-time job which is flexible and can do from home, and when i responded ok, she referred me to kai xuan, ""agent of valtech"", who contacted me on whatsapp to see if i'm interested to know more. Upon finding out the job description, it seems too suspicious to be true. She introduced me to this website ""www.myvaltech.com"" where i can ""submit orders"" and earn commission.

How this works:
1) create an account under her referral, 2) give her my referral for her to sign me up under her, 3) help her account to grab 50 orders first which earn my account earn 20% commissions

4) to complete 50 orders, halfway through you will get a negative balance, because of ""high value orders"" which gives ""triple commission"" so you need to top up by contacting the customer service +65 8804 6658 on WhatsApp, very unprofessional. She makes you believe that you don't have to fork out any money while she does the fund transfer and sends you the screenshot and ask you to forward to the customer service. Why couldn't she do it herself? It is to show you that this ""process"" is legit.

I read another scam alert that subsequently they will ask you to use the 20% comms deposited to your account to go to your account and finish 40 orders before you can withdraw the principal and commissions money. So i stopped at 4) as I felt suspicious throughout and did not want to provide any further personal details or money. I believe this scam works by locking your money away, lets you withdraw some commission and the principal, but then afterwards the order amount gets large enough that you have to keep topping up.. $1000+...$10,000+... And so on. Then maybe one day, you cannot withdraw.

Red flags:
1) from the website, it claimed to be under ""valtech"", but the logo quality is obviously low and they just replace the company name all the time (there was a similar scam using ey's name, today it's valtech, tomorrow maybe it's apple...)

2) the money is too good to be true. $1-$30 commission per order clicked. Each click takes like 5 seconds.
3) why would company's introduction not mention anything, uses colored font with multiple icons etc. Totally low level ui design that is randomly put together

4) the english used by the website and customer service is totally unprofessional.

If you want extra income, find a proper side income by starting your own small home business, do grab, courier delivery, etc. Don't trust in such systems. Don't waste your time on easy money.

Be wary, if you need to top up with your own cash. Nothing comes easy, especially money.","Name: adeline, kaixuan, valtech",Contact: 88979080,

Anonymous , 09 Jan 2022,Investment Scam,"Connected with ‘Hayden’ (Taiwanese who has worked in HK before and is working in SG now) on the Hinge app in early Dec. We moved to Telegram on the same day and he deleted his profile the next day (RF). We talked on Telegram for 2 weeks, in English and Chinese, before he introduced me to the fake/spoofed crypto trading website. I brought up the topic of meeting physically and/or video call but he would declined by saying that he wants to take it slow/changed the topic(RF).

I caught him using fake photos(catfish!) and info since his words often didn’t match his Hinge profile (RF). He admitted it and told me he has trust issues with people because of his broken family and experiences and I was dumb to accept it for that hit my sore spot.

We temporarily ended the convo in Week 3, but he still Telegram me a few days later to ‘invest’ again. I trusted his “investment advice” because of his financially savvy image portrayed during our investment discussion.

Some other Red Flags(RF) about the platform:
1) Weird weblinks (ending with .xyz) that was changed every few days. One of them even triggered Chrome to show that it is a phishing website.
2) The mobile app by “Oriental Wealth”, a fake company with fake logo. User interface quite suspicious with broken English and invalid webpages(e.g. user agreement page).
3) Informed by “Customer Service” (CS) on Whatsapp(HK#) to transfer money to some personal bank accounts (most likely job scam victims), which changed whenever I deposited into the “trading account”.

4) Platform has options to ‘invest’ in 60s(min.$100HKD), 120s($1000HKD) and 12hrs settings. Longer period need more capital($) and can generate more ‘profit’(Online betting!!!)

5) He will ‘analyse’ the BTC chart and calculate the amount($) for me to key in into the website/app (buy long/short) for each ‘trade’, based on his special algorithm.
I started with $500SGD and $2000SGD with the 60s setting for the first 2 tries and got back the capital with the ‘profits’ in my bank account by the next day.
I pumped in $4kSGD next and ‘traded’ a few rounds and stopped when he said the “market was volatile”. Those few rounds didn’t “meet the minimum transaction volume” and they didn’t approve my withdrawal request.

I told him about it, and he persuaded met to try the 120s option to get more profit. Since he will “cover” the additional $6kSGD by informing the CS that he topped up the “trading ID”, I relented. This time, the profits ballooned to around $30kSGD.

I checked with CS a few days later when the money wasn’t in and they directed me to ‘service department”, whom informed me that my account was frozen due to the large foreign transaction and need to pay 15% of the withdrawal amount in 10 days or forfeit that $(profit+capital)(RF). I checked online (scamalert website etc) and finally accepted that I’ve been scammed.

I came to check on scam alert before proceeding and realised many other reported cases shared the same outline. I stopped immediately thus no losses was incurred. You can refer to other stories here to see how they carry on with the scam.

Anonymous , 03 Jan 2022,Job Scam,"1. I was approached by an 'agent' claming that i would be able to earn quick and easy money by boosting view counts of items for websites on 29 dec 2021.

The website used by the scammers was under a company called meiro. They keep changing the website logins to different domains such as:
a. Www.bestmeiro.com
b. Www.y-meiro.com
c. Www.b-bestmeiro.com

they claim that the changing of websites was to ensure that their webpage is secure and safe.

After their pestering, I decided to sign up for an account by using another scammer's phone number (offering loans) and was able to successfully sign up for an account. After which, the scammer offered to let me use his accounts to boost missions, under the disguise of getting me familiar with the platform. I followed his instructions in performing the necessary until it requires a monetary top up in the system. The system prompted that i had hit a package mission which would require the monetary top up, according to the scammers once the package mission is completed. The user would be untitled entitled 3% commission. Knowing that it’s definitely a scam, I continued playing along with the scammer and requested for him to perform the necessary. While still logged in his account, I changed his passwords in the system, hoping to render his account useless.

Till date, he has yet to confront me on the matter.

After the trial on his account, it was my turn to boost missions in my own account. Apparently, my account was linked to his account and i would be receiving 25 % of the commission he receives. I was told to check on my account to verify if the money was reflected inside and i would be able to start boosting my missions. Eventually, I am stuck at a point where by i would need to top up money due to being 'lucky' in getting a package mission. This would require me to speak to their customer service, for me to top up the funds.

I contacted my agent (linda) as I’m not able to deposit anymore and what she recommend me is to complete the data.

After cooling down and telling my parent, I think I’m being scammed and decided to stop. If this system is real, I should be able to get back my deposit amount after 180 days.

Anonymous , 21 Dec 2021,Job Scam,"An “agent” pm me supposedly offering a job but it was like an order task to get commission.
There are several tiers - 0-5 - which will result in varying commissions. Vip0 is basic and I earned about $3.50 a day and minimum withdrawal is $50.
After withdrawing, you will need to put in $20 to earn again. This part is the red flag and I did not proceed. In addition, the agent sent me an invite to telegram group whereby u will find people who are like-minded, putting in like 1k/2k and even 5k and seeing them do mission and withdraw daily. In my opinion, I feel those people in the grp are a bunch of fake acc. When asked in the group chat about the background of company and a proof, the admin will brush away the question. I went to check their profile and almost all the profile pic were created in the early of dec.

The activity required me to make orders of products. one round consisted of 40 orders before completion and withdrawal of funds. at certain phases, a top up of funds would be required. she explained that these top ups indicated ""bonuses"" - chances of earning more commission. it appeared to be true as the commission would increase after the top ups. she would top up to her account for me to complete the experience. once completed, she added me to a group chat consisting of her group of members and she asked me to use my account to try.

For the first round using my account, she said I could use the referral amount and commission i earned using her account to try, amounting to approx. $55. the first round was successfully completed and i managed to withdraw all the money, profitting approximately $60. for the second round, a larger initial deposit of $100 was required. multiple top ups of larger amounts was required. i deposited multiple amounts of hundreds of dollars while accumulating 40 orders, amounting to a total of $2000. I expressed my worries and anxiety on the group chat but was reassured by the members who claimed that they had been doing this for quite awhile with no issues. after i had deposited more than $2000, a fourth top top up of $2800 was required.

long story short, after seeing and experiencing for myself (using her acc) that the money is indeed not lost, I topped up $100 to try for myself. completed 45 orders but couldnt cash out as it was 11+pm and their CS 'closed' at 1030pm. I tried to withdraw the next day but they said that I would need to complete another 45 as it is a new day. I completed till 10 when there's a premium mission of $540. thinking it would be the last, I deposited and met with $1600. I told Maggie I have no more money and she offered to help deposit $500 so I deposited another $1100. but the next premium appeared and require me to deposit $2.5k++ which I am not able to.

I contacted CS for a solution to get my money back but they say I have to follow the rules of the platform. when asked Maggie to meet me to help me complete and take back her money, she refused to meet up, using covid as a reason. told them I will go to the police, they say police will not be able to help me as the only solution is to complete 45 to be able to withdraw. ask CS for company address and they gave me 138 market street #32-01 Capitalgreen Singapore 048946 which I googled and direct me to Rakuten. when I ask for their company reg number, CS told me to just go to the police, saying that their company has its own team of lawyers.

they also added me into a group where others share their earnings. not sure if its real or not. my guess is they're all the same person with fake display pictures.

They didn’t block me nor removed me from group. Maggie doesn't seem interested/desperate to get her $500 back and both stopped contacting me. Since then I’ve went to the police and contacted my bank.

The money you transferred to will be a vendor account that will change every 10mins or so that is given to you by a WhatsApp customer service.

Nonetheless, due to my greed, which makes me let guard down now that I realized when it was too late, I continued.

When I pressed ""3"" to find out more I was routed a guy who only spoke Chinese who said if i gave him my name it would look up to see what the situation is. He then said that I had come into contact with a Covid-positive patient the day before at Tan Tock Seng hospital and that I would be taken away and quarantined for 10 days within 2 hours. I asked for more details he said the hospital had my mobile number and also a Shanghai registered mobile number. When I said that I do not have a Shanghai number, he said that I would need to contact the Shanghai police station in Pudong to make a report, and once NCID received the report back from them the quarantine would be lifted. But it had to be done within 2 hours. He then put me through to the Shanghai police station where I spoke with an officer who sent me his police credentials via WhatsApp etc to verify that I was talking with a legitimate police officer. He also called me from the police station's number but wanted to conduct most of the call via WhatsApp instead.

However, in order to file a report, I had to WhatsApp him a photo of my Singapore ic. But I became suspicious when later on, according a ""central bureau"" investigation, I was suddenly a suspect in a major money laundering case in Singapore as apparently there is an industrial and commercial bank of china (ICBC) account in my name that was part of the case. He proceeded to question me in the case, sharing details of the main culprits, the people they have hurt, etc and how I needed to cooperate with them to help solve this. But they told me i couldn't tell anyone else about this, and also had to check in with him 3 times a day moving forward. That's when I politely ended the call, and then immediately called NCID to speak with the ""Mr. Sun yun"" who originally contacted me and found out that NCID doesn't do contact tracing at all, and they have also been getting calls from the public who have received such calls and called them to verify. So then I realized for sure that it was a scam. I didn't lose any money, but unfortunately they have my personal information now, so there is a high chance of identity theft moving forward. This scam was very believable because the ""police officer"" seemed very knowledgeable and used all of the police & legal terms you would expect in this situation, and gave friendly advice about how to avoid identity theft in the future (the irony of it all).

They might change company names or even phone numbers so beware of that.

So many people have fell for this stay safe guys im lucky i don't have much money in the first place so i stopped early here are some things that made me fell for it so you won't too
1) family pictures (somehow felt like they can't be bad people lmao)
2) an existing company name
3) the high pay of course and the promise of getting a ""bonus"" commission if you commit one week
4) using their own money at first to earn commission
5) having ""new people"" in the group
6) they warn you to be careful of scam (ironic right)
7) make themselves seem highly secure
8) group members send pictures of their scrumptious meals and earnings in the group

I’ve already contacted the bank to recall my money and lodged a police report. Do contact your bank and have your I-banking deactivated in case they manage to gain access into your account you will still be able to use your card and the bank and police will liaise together to try their best to solve your issue. They were really helpful with it so don’t be embarrassed to contact them but do take note that it is not guaranteed that you'll get your money back. I've read through similar stories after I got scammed and one said that the scammer told them that even the police won’t be able to help them but my advice is just lodge a report anyways and provide as many information as you can to the police.

Anonymous , 06 Nov 2021,Job Scam,"i was introduced to this friend by my mother's friend for a job – the number (+60
1112198241) whereby one can earn commission by helping the seller to purchase order using a system that is auto generated and will match it according to the money that is deposited.

To summarize – we are being issued orders within one click and will be intelligently matched orders and be earning non-stop commission.

So firstly, had deposited SGD $300 into the account and we were instructed to paynow 98527515 and send a screenshot to the “Customer service” +65 85738125 and we will then receive an instruction to go into the app “Club Factory” and go to top up and then put in the amount that we had paynow to the person and include the screenshot in the app.

So everything seemed fine when I had received 2 orders amounting to $899 which is insufficient as I had only topped up $300. Hence, I was told that the consecutive orders which are the 2 orders have to be completed in order to proceed and I had to top up $900 to complete the order and the money will be back into the system account and I can continue to proceed.

To my surprise , I got a double order again and this time it amounts to $1099 and I had to top up another $1100 and I had to transfer to UOB 37039291?? REN ZENGSHA?? as I have to message the “Customer service” to get the account to transfer to always before sending the money.

After the money was in the account, I continued and to my horror, 3 orders in a row came in together and amounting up to $1997 and this time round I had to top up $2000 and I was assured that having multiple orders is normal and the max is 3 orders. The orders started to get more and more expensive, and the person kept rushing me to find money to complete orders as there is a time limit to it.

After which I requested for a refund/ withdraw and I want my money back total $2300 and the “Customer service” said it was unable to proceed with my request and couldn’t get back my money. After repeated request to withdraw, she said that she need to communicate with the seller and need to apply for me and keep making excuses till the point that I mentioned that I will be going to the police, she threatened me that if the company have any losses / damages I have to take responsibility as they will hire lawyers to sue me and the platform will fully cooperate with the police investigations as all transactions are being recorded down and there is an SOP that they are following.",Name: CLUB FACTORY,Contact: 601112198241,

The person goes by the name of Jessica (no last name or full name given), and claims to be from glint interns looking for data analysis positions. Jessica claimed that you only need to work 2-3 hours a day and you can earn from $80. Thinking it might be an internship opportunity, I replied and said I was interested.

I was redirected to WhatsApp and someone else claiming to be Jacky, who claimed to be from quartile. He had a +65 number so i feel more assured. He explained to me what the job does, said it was for 40 missions and help other companies promote their products. I initially expected it to be a data analysis job where I would be filling in spreadsheets, so i was a little confused by this. I asked him how long would one work daily he said just 30 minutes, and i was weirded out by the discrepancy.

He gave me a website to sign up and I did not know what the trade password was, he said it was the password used to withdraw. The website looked nicely done but it felt suspicious because it was a html and i could not find much detail about the company online and has no headquarters in Singapore, so i had a suspicion that they might be from overseas, which is risky.

The website was too suspicious for me since the website had no links to the official website and had different link domain from the official. When I clicked on some buttons the website just turned into some gibberish html with Chinese words in it which looks like people from china made it. Then I asked him what the company was about and he just told me a copy pasted thing from the official website. At this point i felt something was very wrong and declined his offer and he asked why.

Ignoring him he attempted to call me but i declined and blocked him.

The more money u start with the more u end up needing to top up bc you'll get larger orders.
I played along while suspicious of it day 1 only needed to top up $50 total got back everything + commission. Day 2 hit an order to top up $600 did not do so. Tried to bypass the system by earning more 30% commission but was told by Evon the negative balance will not be cancelled off by new incoming commission.

She let me use her account to complete the first 45 data and i will get 30% commission upon completion. She guided me to their website (https://www.cja-ffiliate.life/index/user/register) to register an account with an invitation code. As a start, she transferred money using her own bank account to the account provided. Once the money has been top up, she told me to click on start making money, start grabbing orders and click submit for 45 orders. While doing, i encountered an error which did not allow me to proceed as there were insufficient funds and it is showing a negative amount. She told me that she has to recharge and i will get the bank account from customer service again. After I completed 45 orders, I screenshot and sent to her. She told to check the commission in my account and complete the 45 orders in my account. I did the same and transferred a total of $60. While I was doing halfway, the site crashed.
I told Jessye about it and she told me to check with customer service, I was told the site was under maintenance. I was given a new website thereafter. After I completed my 45 orders, she taught me how to withdraw money. I withdrew a total of $224. Jessye added me to a WhatsApp group with 13 people.
It seems like an easy job earning so much just by clicking. I introduced this job to my friend and got her to do the same. However, the amount of money she has to top up is more than mine. We felt that it was strange transferring to top up the funds as the funds in the account just kept increasing after we submit to grab items which doesn’t make sense. We went online to search more about this and learnt that someone she knew was cheated $7k. At the end of the day even though we have nothing to lose we decided to stop.

I told the person I did not. The caller identified himself as Eric Lang LAZADA ID 346189 and said I can call the company to verify. He then said to cancel the transaction the company is sending an OTP. I received the OTP at that time. He then asked me to give the the number as they want to use this number to block the transaction. I began saying the first number of the OTP when noticed the OTP message stated do not share even with LAZADA. I then questioned them and he said that he will transfer me to his superior to explain. He then said the company had called me to prevent the fraud but I was not cooperating so he said he can proceed to approve the transaction. I then told him are you threatening me? I then asked him to confirm his name and ID but he was keeping on talking about transferring the call. I cut the line.

Anonymous , 28 Oct 2021,Job Scam,"Be aware of freelance job scams, which involves increasing the popularity boosting of online products, in my case was on shopback site. One has to click 40 items to complete what they called a mission.

The number of missions is randomised, which culminated to 3 times of one’s online commissions.

One is given $20 credit to start.
I “ earned “ $69 on day one but was scammed of $4018 on day two.

The number of missions on shopback site will keep increasing and one needs to recharge via paynow when there is a negative in the wallet.

One will be tempted to keep topping up, in order to try to recover one’s initial capital.

It got to a point where it is impossible to top up.

I was included in a group chat and one of the members even suggested that i can consider either borrowing money or pawn my belongings just to tide over the negative amount.

I then made a police report accordingly. The scammers are simply heartless, scheming and professional.

The jobsdb on telegram seemed legit until it became a deleted account. My suspicion was further confirmed after I was removed from the WhatsApp group.

Please never trust that money cannot come so easily.,

terrible lesson learnt,
all the sites seemed legit.","Name: Jobsdb, shOpback",Contact:,
Anonymous , 28 Oct 2021,Job Scam,"I received a telegram message from Blaire Yen @mynameisblaireeyen, asking me if I wanted part time job to which i agreed. She then had asked for my number to be referred to another person who would share with me more about the job scope.  
I provided the person with my contact and was contacted later by a person called annie at +65 88060576 via WhatsApp.

She claimed to be working for big-commerce and asked me to go to a website https://www.bcp-rojec.com/ (their platform) and register an account. That platform only required for name, password and phone number. Annie then explained to me how to do the job which is to grab order that comes in.

Every order that comes in I have to click on grab and sometimes the balance would turn negative as I was informed that it was a package order, which I have to top up cash to make it back to 0, paid to the merchant. This is to complete one order an there is about 40 orders per set. Only after completing the set, I will be able to receive the money (commission).

In total, I had completed 2 sets and received commission (which bought my trust). I was sucked in and went on with the 3rd set, which halfway through the cost of items was too much and i could not afford it. (regardless I was not going to get back the money...) The customer service continued to prompt/threaten me to complete the order or my account will be frozen. I was stressed and surrendered to it at that moment...

I have lost a total of s$26,600/-

Anonymous , 28 Oct 2021,Job Scam,"I was introduced to a guy by the name of Joshua who told me that I can earn money by downloading apps from voodoo gaming. I was going to earn around $5-$8.88 per job. 
Joshua told me that voodoo gaming has a long queue of people waiting. He asked if I would like to try another way of making money. He gave me his credentials to sign in to ebay-nicegoods.com, and proved to me that he only needed to recharge thrice with a small amount and he could get back his money. All it needed was for us to complete 60 orders, and we could withdraw the wallet amount with principal sum and commission.
I introduced the website to my sister that night, thinking it was legitimate.
I tried putting in $5,000 at the start. At the 16th order, I realised that had to top up $9,000+ to my wallet to continue receiving orders. Afraid that i will have to do more big recharges, with the fact that the recharge amount is so high, found it suspicious and stopped.
My sister invested $1,500 at the start. She made about 8 recharges thereafter. The amount she has invested into this website is $53,000. She made the recharges thinking she could simply finish making the 60 orders and get her money back.
Instead, at the 57th order, her wallet balance showed negative $35,000+. She needed to top up this amount to continue finishing the 3 orders. She got suspicious because there was no guarantee that she could finish up the 60 orders without further recharge.
These people claimed to be from e-bay Singapore, merchants who wanted to give people commission to boost their sales value. But, upon investigation and our persistent hounding, they did not provide any proof that they were from ebay. All questions about who they were glossed over.
I spent the entire day trying to get back my money from the chatbox provided in the website. Kelly ooi claimed that we could surrender the wallet but pay 50% penalty.
This was not told to us beforehand, and we did not want to be paying $30,000 for nothing. Upon further negotiation, she mentioned the penalty could be lowered to 18%. We were so exhausted that we wanted to close the case and go with this 18% penalty (a loss of $10,800 for nothing).
However, she later told us that she cannot process the refund, citing that we need to give back 18% then the wallet will refund back to us. This did not make any sense because we don't even have anymore money in our wallet.
Please beware about ebay-nicegoods.com (Note: Scam site, do not click) it is a scam and we are unsure if we can get our money back. The person from the chat was even so arrogant as to tell us to lodge a police report, and that they would cooperate with the police. But when we asked for their details, they mia-ed.",Name:,Contact:,

But me being skeptical, I had done my due diligence to do image reserve lookup and searching social media for her name, but found nothing more about this person. So I felt safe to continue but with a cautious mind, we chatted for 2 days. As and when she would mention that she was doing a “part time” job with Zalora to help boost its online search engine optimization. As someone who is in the it industry I felt something fishy, but I am not exposing her yet. For one I really felt some connection between us.

Only until she asked for a small favour from me, to help complete her “part time” job with Zalora so that she could meet me on the weekends. I agreed with cautious…

Moment later, she sent me a phone number and a sentence of text to send to that number though WhatsApp. The text to send was, “Zalora customer service, referrer was, Ng Rui Xin”. Once sent, a series of reply returned with some Chinese words and badly structured sentences/grammar. This was the red light for me. I immediately told her i felt uncomfortable and sorry that I couldn’t help with her “part time” job. Thereafter she got really mad and said she thought she found someone sincere and all those trying to make me guilty words. But I said “bye bye” to her, block and report in WhatsApp.

Anonymous , 26 Oct 2021,Job Scam,"I was first approached on telegram by someone named Alicia asking if I am looking for flexible part time job and to message her back if I am interested to find out more. So i ask her for more details and she told me to provide her my contact number as someone else will WhatsApp me further on the details of the job scope, i gave her my number thinking that no harm to find out more about the details since no obligations.

A while later, someone by the name Joline messaged me on WhatsApp and immediately explained to me the job scope.

Job scope:
A job that require us to help merchants to boost their viewing rate and visibility to increase sales and traffic on the online shopping. tutorial will be provided. It takes 20-30 mins per day to complete 45 tasks and can withdraw commission directly after completing all tasks.

(sounds like a good deal... however...)

She proceeded saying i will be registering an account by using her invitation code so that we both will get commissions when we grab orders. (at this point it lured me in to give it a try since she say tutorial). She went on teaching me how to grab orders in the platform and there were a few large orders (which means more commissions earned, triple the commission) and having to transfer a certain amount into the online shopping platform to continue grabbing orders.

(Also the online platform that they told me to register an account with is target...)

After this tutorial, she asked me to try it on my own (complete 45 orders). I started grabbing small orders until I hit a large order (triple commission) and they asked me to transfer $43 first, subsequently on my next grab of order, i chanced upon another large order (triple commission) and asked me to transfer another $13. (i was at my 25 order or so). by now, i felt something was not right but i was told that i had to continue to complete my orders in order to take back the amount i transferred into the platform and the commissions earned from grabbing.

After completing all orders, she then went through with me the steps on how to withdraw my commissions earned that day. in total I withdraw $185 which included the amount I put into the platform ($53) and commissions earned that day ($132). That is when i stopped as I felt very uncomfortable to continue.

I just want to share my story and bring awareness to others of this ongoing situation that happened to me about a week ago. (also decided to share my story after seeing many others posted a similar story as mine).

This time the customer service told me that I was supposed to transfer FOR 3 PIECES OF THE SAME item (total $4101) I believed the customer service and transfer the BALANCE amount ($1367 X 2 = $2734) BUT WAS TOLD THAT I DID NOT INFORM THEM BEFORE I TRANSFERRED AND THE SYSTEM DID NOT CAPTURE THE TRANSACTION.

Quoting her, the job is as follows:

""For boost one mission you will get $0.52-$8.52. So perday you may earn $80-120.Every day you can boost 40 missions, and you can withdraw money on the platform after completing 40 missions""

The customer service person by the name of ammar bakhtiar (acc no. 713553394001; +65 8895 6937) told me that the orders were randomised and he has no control over it. He told me not to cause any trouble and they have a legal team. If i want my money back I just have to recharge and complete the orders. It hit me that i might be a victim of a job scam given that the job responsibilities of a customer service officer was to serve at the customer best interests. I contacted alyssa to tell her about my problem. Alyssa told me that she could lend me $5,000 but for her own guaranteed, she instigated that i take a photo with my ic and a naked photo of myself. That's when i confirmed she was an accomplice.

I immediately proceed to the nearest police station to lodge a police report and called the bank to notify about the transactions. At the police station i learnt that there was victims who reported on the same scam as well and was grateful that i did not borrow any money to put it in that account.

I understand that the website had since been taken down by the Police but people in the group are still uploading photos of themselves completing the ""job"" and sharing articles on government efforts to help retailers in e-commerce. The group consist of 12 members and is operated by 3 admins.

Anonymous , 19 Oct 2021,Investment Scam,"There’s a lot of MT5 (MetaTrader 5) scams lately, I’ve recently scammed 30k sgd out of me, therefore I like to share my experience as an awareness to the public hoping to save someone from being scam out there.

Part 1 of the scam is to gather information from you and gaining your trust. How they do this is by adding an attractive face into their profile and start chatting with you, at the same time faking to build a long trusting relationship with you.

Part 2 of the scam is they will let you know about their relative who works in the bank and obtain inside news, they will also hint you about the profit they are making to get you curious, they will be very patient in this until you got totally interested and wanted to start making some pocket money with them.

Part 3 of the scam is to get you to download MT5 on your phone and open an account with their fake broker.

Part 4 of the scam. They will give you their inside news when to buy or sell at a specific time of the day, their purpose is to show you how much money you can make within few mins so that you give in to your own greed.

Part 5 of the scam. They will try to convince you that this news is hard to come by and so to treasure this news best is to deposit bigger so that one trade will be around 10% of your account value then that where you will fall into your own greed and deposit more hoping to earn more profit quickly.

Part 6 of the scam. During this stage the broker will release a few dollars for your withdraw however when you wanted to withdraw a big amount that where they will put a stop and inform you that you need to pay a fee of 20% of your profit as part of the investment taxes.

Part 7 of the scam. Most people during this stage have already know that they have fallen into the scam but if you really pay for their 20% fee their next scam would freeze your account due to illegal arbitrage because your account is constantly making profits and they demand a sum of money from you to unlock it or else your account will be deleted forever losing every money in it however if you pay for it they will just keep ignoring you from now on.

Moral of the story here is the scammers are a team working together. The inside news that they send you is just simply mirrored and altering of MetaTrader platform data to show you fake results so that you trust what you are looking at and fallen into your own greed.

2. staff said job 3 has 2 task and confirmed with me that i had to add 2 of the item, then trf the remaining $500. after which, the job is complete and i will receive my refund (aka 1 item = 1 task).

But i didnt see his face it was all black. Then he called me to explain that he would transfer me $300 first to my account. I have to transfer him $500 to clear and will receive the loan afterwards. I told him i couldn't find $500 in such a short period of time.

He asked me to transfer $200 to defer 1 week. So the next week, I had the $500 already to clear. I transferred him but he said cannot ibanking transfer have to cash deposit to the account. He told me to find another $500 to cash deposit. I said i couldn't as i have no more money left. I ask him to transfer me back the money so i could do cash deposit instead but he say could not.

He said transfer $200 to defer the loan and clear $500 nextweek. I said its ur faulty because your bank account got problem and not mine so why must i i transfer you back $200 to defer the loan when its ur account got problem.

After the transfer, I was routed to the finance person, who said will activate my bank account for future repayment. that account activation would cost me $4000 and she told me it's refundable.

amount paid up till this point:

ADMIN FEE ($3000) - UOB 42239673??
STAMP DUTY FEE ($3000) - STANDARD CHARTERED 40297847??
ACCOUNT ACTIVATION ($3000) - STANDARD CHARTERED 40297847??

I was routed to the manager, mike. he called me (in ah beng fashion) and asked if I have paid for government tax. I was in shock, because to get a loan, i need to fork out that much of money. and this point of time, other than being really tired of having to fork out money before i get the money, my scam radar finally kicked in. looking at their whatsapp bio, the email stated was LENDINGBEE.ORG.SG@GMAIL.COM, which obviously suspicious. not only that, there were many typo errors on the contract.

Instead of calling mike to tell him that he is a scam (or potentially a loan shark), i told him i want to exit this thing. he told me, in order to exit, i would need to fork out 20K, as per the contract. however they would return 10K to me. out of my mind, losing 20k is better than they coming to my house or office to harrass me, i called up the legitimate licenced moneylender for loan to pay for the 20K and to exit the scam.

Not only did the LEGITIMATE LICENCED MONEYLENDER stopped my application upon hearing that I was borrowing money to pay for scam, they helped me to call the scam hotline and told me to make police report. they even told me not to be scared of them and reassured me that things would be okay.

By grabbing things in ecommerce platform called overstock, just to boost order numbers which need to complete 45 mission than they allow to withdraw back the funds with commission given to you. All you need to do is to top-up the goods amount and paynow to different people. Every time bank account given was different.

The orders were small initially. I managed to withdraw the first round and I thought thinking it was safe,

But at the 2nd attempt, the top up amount grew, I could only withdraw upon completion of 45 missions; the product price is boosting up to $8000 and that time I had already transfer $11k. Asking me to ask for a loan to pump in the account, but I claimed that i had run out of fund and almost all the people said can lend me the balance of $500 unless i top up the remanding $7500.

I whatsapp-ed the company asking for a refund but they said ""u must complete the 45 tasks then only can withdraw all.""

The system has strict rules that everyone must complete 40 orders before withdrawal. If the merchant complained 3 times, then you are deemed to have not completed the order. It will then be frozen. To unfreeze, the only way is to reduce the number of agents who do not complete the order you need to find a way to finish as soon as possible and hopefully you can withdraw your funds and get your commission back as soon as possible .Then, I quickly went to NPC to lodge a report.

He provided me with an email address to contact him to arrange meetup or post, but his account was suspended within the next few minutes. This screams red flag but I still emailed him as I thought there could be valid reasons why his account was suspended, besides the items were not expensive. I even wrote to Carousell enquiring about user's account but they were unable to disclose any info due to their privacy policy and even cautioned me not to proceed with any ongoing transactions with him. Anyway buyer goes by the name of Anthony who was very polite and prompt in all his replies, even though he is based in USA and wants to send the items to someone in Malaysia (another red flag). He sent me recipient's mailing address and contact number and wanted to know cost of items and shipping fees, agreeing to pay either through PayPal or bank transfer. All this while, I was thinking as long as I don't receive payment, I will not ship items out so there's nothing to lose.

After informing him that he has to pay me S$17 for the items plus overseas shipping, he decided to purchase more items amounting to over S$100 without a single enquiry (yet another red flag). Total cost of additional items incl registered international mail amounted to S$130.60 and he proceeded to pay via bank transfer without hesitation. I received a transfer confirmation email almost immediately (see attached screenshots) from ""Citibank"". Upon looking at the email content, I knew straightaway it was a scam.

By buying things in ECOMMERCE platform just to boost order numbers. need to complete 40 mission than they allow to withdraw back the funds with commission given to you. All you need to do is to top-up the differences sent to paynow . +65854803??

The orders were small INITIALLY. I managed to withdraw the first round, thinking it was safe,

But 2nd time, the top up amount grew, I could only withdraw upon completion of 40 missions; asking me to ask for a loan to pump in the account, but it give me red flag ... so I never continue after reading . I lost over $300 though 

I Whatsapp-ed the company asking for a refund but they said ""who do u think I am? Do you think I can control it.""

The system has strict rules that everyone must complete 40 orders before withdrawal. If the merchant complained 3 times, then you are deemed to have not completed the order. It will then be frozen. To unfreeze, the only way is to reduce the number of agents who do not complete the order You need to find a way to finish as soon as possible and hopefully you can withdraw your funds and get your commission back as soon as possible . Okay dear, then you can leave it n make the lost . The number is +6580100483 . (scams)""

Anonymous , 01 Oct 2021,Internet Love Scam,"I met this person from tantan, a dating app. We started dating after his confession. He knew i have some forex trading experiences. So, he insisted me to switch my broker to the one he was using. The company is named “richness empire”. It is infamous for its scam tactics. I knew when I researched on it. However, blinded by love and his words of assurance, I still opened an account. Yes, I was out of my mind.

Richnes? Empir? has a simple interface website for you to check your account, but top-up is done via whatsapp, a so-called customer service number was given to me by that person. For withdrawal, you have to submit a request on the website, then inform the customer service. You will be given personal bank accounts to transfer, which i later found out these are the individuals who are either assisting, or being scammed by probably the same criminal syndicate.

Profits were raking in. I was blinded by greed and was slowly encouraged to top-up until the deposit hit usd50k. In between, the person transferred usd5k, and i managed to withdraw usd3k. Due to multiple top-ups and one transfer, richness empire accused me of money laundering and froze my account. They demanded usd20k to unfreeze, and i paid. When my account unfroze, i submitted a withdrawal request. It wasn’t processed, and the excuse given was “due to high volume of transactions”.

Two days later, Richness? Empir? accused me of illegal arbitrage because the account is constantly profiting. They suspended my withdrawal and froze my account again, demanding another usd30k. I told them I will make a police report. They told me to do so, but I will still have to pay them to unfreeze my account. I accepted the fact I was scammed and went to make a police report.

Oh ya, about the usd3k withdrawal, it was transferred to my bank account by 2 individuals. I initially thought they were part of the company. However, one of them is a victim of a love scam. As a result, i was accused of money laundering. Luckily, I lodged a report much earlier than him.

She will try to tell you about her life, then slowly bring in this part-time qoo10 job that she's been doing for several months. She also uses more than one contact number. But basically will ask you to visit this qoo10 page, screenshot the item to confirm the item (which is strange), supposedly to increase page view. You are then asked to transfer $100 to pay the merchant. And you will receive a 5-10% commission.
The scammer also try to help you pay for the item first, through bank transfer, then ask you to give your bank account, to receive money from the merchant, in order to gain your trust. Other tactics include guilt-tripping.

Anonymous , 16 Sep 2021,Internet Love Scam,"Got to know this guy from Facebook dating app. Only after chatting for a day or a day or two, they will advance super quickly to ask you to chat on another platform, like WhatsApp or telegram.

told me that he is a Singaporean, but was raised in the us. Father is like a nomad, always moving around countries to countries. First to the UK, then to the us and settled down there. He will share with you sob stories of how his parents died in a car accident few years back, his fiancee broke up with him just before their wedding because she found out she is at the final stage of some cancer, does not have any family members around because their relationship was not good. Only have 1 best friend who is currently serving the army in Afghan. He is an oil rig consultant. Works offshore, and operates independently. Got himself a place here in Singapore. Told me that he has to travel to Houston for a submit conference, even screenshot to show you the content of his last minute invitation. Told me he has an oil rig contract to fulfil in Ukraine in 2 weeks’ time.

Things started escalating quickly, he will just suddenly and randomly drop you a random WhatsApp call, and try to guilt trip you that you are avoiding him. And shortly after chatting, they will say they love you and ask you to be his partner. Even if they haven't seen you. Their reasoning is, they know that you are the one for them.

i requested for a video call. But he gave quite a number of ridiculous reasoning like he can't do video calls because of where he is. But promise to call me on a certain day when he goes back to Baltimore.

Scammer will try to sweet talk you and make you believe in him. Once he got to Ukraine for his contract, 2 weeks later, he will call or send you a text that his mud pump is faulty and he needed financial help. I was sceptical at first, but the way they speak to you, is so believable that you will think is true. And he sounded really desperate that all i wanted was to help, which I eventually did. And reasons for him asking for more money became more ridiculous, like paying his supplier and his workers, or having no money to eat, and needing to take a private jet back to the USA, so he can pay everyone that he has asked to borrow money from. When i suggested to him to take a commercial flight, another stupid reason came out again, and he will guilt trip you by saying you don't understand what he is going through.

Anonymous , 16 Sep 2021,Internet Love Scam,"Please be careful when meeting people on dating apps such as tinder, cimb etc.
The scammers will always sweet talk you and say how in love they are with you when you have never met them in person. They will always give excuses when you say you want to meet. They will start introducing you to investment schemes such as lottery apps which they found loopholes and have been earning money from the app which no one is aware.
The usual tactic they use is to entice you with small wins first and let you enjoy the gains for a period.
Then they will start to brainwash you to put more money in so that the returns you get will be higher. Next is tell you there is a once in a lifetime promotion. The more money you put in, the more bonus money you will get in return. He will take the lead first and show you that he has put in all his money in and left you to pump in the money to enjoy the promotion. He will pressurize you with deadline, if the money is not pumped in within certain time, all your existing money in the account will be lost.
Please be more alert when someone start talking to you about investment or money when you have never met the person. These scammers have well thought out plan in mind to use on their victims.

So I gave in and share my personal details such as (ic front and back), CPF contributions and several contact numbers. It was suspicious already that I have to do all of that on WhatsApp and not in real life but I ignored my gut feelings (which I totally regretted). He mentioned to me that I’ll have to deposit 200 to ''secure my loan credit"". It is already fishy, I wanted to back out and I mentioned o him I don’t want this loan anymore and he said, he already transferred me 200 (I assumed that the person whom transferred it to me is one of the scam victims too) , so the next day I have to transfer back 400 to them.

So, the next day, I transferred $400 but the person scolded me cause I did not add remarks for the transfer. So I was told to transfer again. At this point, it's getting ridiculous. I wanted to stop but I remembered they have my ic, like address etc and phone numbers of the people around me. So i give in. I transferred again.

Told him I’m not interested anymore in the call, but he send me the agreement letter and pressured me into signing it. I told him I want to cancel even before the agreement letter, I signed to shut him up but he told me about the cancellation fee is 30%.

So I had to transfer $900. Which I did to stop all of these, but he acted confused, asking where's the other $900 transaction screenshot. I’m like huh why? He said to delete particulars. The agreement stated ""cancellation/delete particulars"" which means the total is $900. So I scolded him with their own agreement they made up, and he argued that he will return the $900 after deleting my particulars + $400 + $200 that I transferred earlier. If you are returning anyway why do I still have to transfer?

But I don't want to take the risk and give him another $900 so I photoshopped a fake transaction screenshot to stall some time while going to the police cos he kept messaging and calling me. It’s annoying.

Referred by a friend, said that she has been doing this “online business/job” for awhile and earning good money, she asked me to join so i did.

Was given contacts via Whatsapp. Told me to make screenshots of products to purchase on their behalf. I first transferred $109 to UOB account name “Gaya” for a phone and got the amount back with 5% commission. With one successful transaction i felt confident to continue.

Second request was a phone priced at $605. I followed similar instructions and transferred to UOB account name “Ruvy”. Then I was told that I made a mistake, it was indicated as 3 units, so it should be $1815. I told them i don’t have that much money. The same friend told me that she will help me by transferring the balance. Now that I looked at her screenshot, it seems suspiciously fake.

I was told to transfer another $1,815 and then we would be able to get all of our money back, with commission. I considered doing it at first as i wished to help my friend too.

Anonymous , 31 Aug 2021,Internet Love Scam,"This happened to a close friend of mine. He is still trying to recover from this scam.

They met on FB. Scammer introduced herself as Christy Koh. Claimed that her father passed away, mother is sick in sg. She's a chemical engineer and a sub contractor to Marteks oil llc. She just won a contract with evergrand energy hk llc to refine crude oil. She is currently working in Amsterdam and trying to export her crude oil products over to evergrand.

Very quickly she asked to move to whatsapp and chat.
They chatted only at specific timing due to 'time difference'. She always showed concern about his daily life and work. It turned romantic very quickly and she claimed that she will be back to sg soon. And she will introduce her mother to him.

A month later, she requested him to transfer her 35k euro so that she can perform the sgs dip test for her oils. He had his doubts, questioned and eventually blocked her. But she continued to use other numbers to call and msg, begging for him to help her out. Very manipulative and always play the pity card. Eventually, he gave in. However, a few weeks later she continued to ask for more money, claiming that there's problems with the testing and needed to pay a huge tax fee.

After doing a google reverse image check, found out she is a scammer because her photos are all stolen from a korean instagramer - @yesbee92 and the company - evergrand energy hk llc doesn't have a company website.

She has contacted him using these numbers- +65 84319259, +65 86197359, + 65 97156568, +65 86197349. She also has several fb accounts under the name christykoh. And an instagram account @christy_koh11.

He lost more than 50k, all of his hard earned money. It was a painful lesson.

He told me that the loan has been APPROVED, that is why he has transferred to my account. I told him that I have never confirm/agree if to take up the loan and only asking for a quote. I insisted he take the money back and he told me that if I were to transfer back, I have to transfer him back $5000 and I asked him back why need to transfer $5000 whereby he only transferred $2500 to my account.

Anonymous , 28 Aug 2021,Job Scam,"I was contacted on telegram by Diana asking if i was looking for a part-time job, and when I responded ok, her boss, elaine, contacted me on Whatsapp to see if I'm interested to know more. upon finding out the job description, it seems too suspicious to be true. she introduced me to this website ""www.ddas.live"" where I can ""grab orders"" and earn commission.

How this works:
1) create an account under her referral, 2) give her my referral for her to sign up, 3) HELP her account TO GRAB 40 ORDERS FIRST which earn my account commissions, 4) using the 20% comms from what i did in her account, i tHEN have $60-80 of commissions in my account, GO TO MY ACCOUNT AND FINISH 40 ORDERS BEFORE I CAN WITHDRAW the principal and commissions money.

To complete 40 orders, halfway through you will get a negative balance, and means you need to top up by contacting the customer service +65 89124534, also the number they gave as their ""company number"". i stopped here as i felt suspicious throughout and did not want to provide any further personal details or money. i believe this scam works by locking your money away, lets you withdraw some commission and the principal, but then afterwards the order amount gets large enough that you have to keep topping up.. $1000+...$10,000+... and so on. then maybe one day, you cannot withdraw.

Suspicious points:
1) from the website, it claimed to be under ""ey international group"", giving sg address of ey. but SG PHONE GIVEN IS THE ABOVE CUST SVC NUMBER, NOT EY OFFICE NUMBER. Australian address is of some ""engineered door solutions"" company.
2) the truth is.. ey, who is big4 accounting firm, will never do order-grabbing business. ey is also not called ey international group. trying to use the name of ey to build credibility to scam people has failed them.

3) if it is ey... a professional firm... why would company's introduction not mention anything, uses colored font with multiple icons etc. totally low level UI design that is randomly put together

4) ""invitation code"" is spelled as ""lnvitation code"", and when u login successfully, the pop up spells ""loginged"" etc. bad spelling found in multiple places.
5) googled the customer service number, saw another recent scam alert for this same order grabbing.

Although the agent/user mentioned she had been doing it for a few months, i'm not convinced. I even warned her to be careful too after I told her I will not be doing it.

The moment they gave up: when you press on into further details on their intention, they gave up and hang up the line. They simply have no patience to phish further. Thus there is no loss for me but they sounded very convincingly, which I believe other folks may fall into their prey easily.

I felt that something was not right so I went in and checked his profile on Carousell and the account was created couple of hours ago before he first approached me for the watches. But because it was Singapore contact number (+65 8401 8902?, I went ahead and still chatted with him since there is a chance he might be a real buyer.

He then proceeded to ask for personal information pertaining to my bank account number, name of bank account holder and address. I did not give him my full account name and gave him an office address instead. But because I told him that I didnt have the watches with me, he wanted to deal with me the next day, on 21st August 2021 morning instead. Around 10pm on 20th August, which is the day itself, I noticed that Carousell has already banned the account - so I thought I am right and that the scammer won't contact me anymore. But on the 21st August morning, the scammer continued to text me on Whatsapp and asked whether if we can deal by 4pm that day. I replied yes, saying that so long as I can sight the funds, then I will pass him the watches. Thereafter he claimed that he can only show me the receipt but the funds will only reach 1-2 days later - that is when I know that it is definitely a scam.",Name: OFFSHORE MARINE CORP,Contact: 84018902,

Anonymous , 20 Aug 2021,Job Scam,"My friend introduced me to a website where you can earn a commission by purchasing an item for an anonymous person. So how it works is that, You create an account on gobigcommerce.live (Note: Scam website), and You can “top up” money there. But the top up works when you transfer the money to this “person”. You will be randomly assigned an item to buy, and it will be done automatically. however, the item purchased can go above the amount you deposit, so you may have to end up topping up the balance just to get back Your money and “commission” afterwards. (Items range from Cheap batteries to expensive jewellery) I previously made one transaction with my friend, and we profited $200 from it. So being greedy, we went ahead to top up the negative balance, when we were told our money was used to buy a more expensive item (top up was done through paynow).

Anonymous , 22 Jul 2021,Internet Love Scam,"I met the guy in facebook dating last 21-may. He introduced himself as philip chang, a 41 year old singaporean who grew up in houston texas. He’s an oil rig engineer and independent contractor with plans to settle down in singapore hence he’s looking for a partner. The persona he has created is someone who’s an introvert with little knowledge of the internet. Growing up as an asian in the us has turned him into a quiet loner due to the bullying. His dad died when he was a kid and grew up with his mom until she died of cancer 8 years ago. He has an uncle, a retired priest currently staying in a home. He only had 2 girlfriends in the past, 1st turned out to be a drug addict and the 2nd cheated on him with someone he knows. Since then he is married to his job.
He was very patient, we chatted for almost 2 months in getting to know each other. Part of his daily routine is to do sermons, studying the bible by himself. He went to orphanages with his mom to donate. He shared a story of his worker stealing money from him through online banking which is why he doesn’t use online banking anymore. One day, he won a bidding contract in ukraine and had to fly there with his workers. His agent was waiting there with local workers. In ukraine, he shared the strict rules in safety measures in the rig like they can’t take pictures, videos or calls. He began sending love poems via email. Suddenly there were sea pirates who attacked their rig but no one was hurt. Our daily routine was chatting to find out if the other is ok. He’s able to fill my days with his messages. Then came my fear, their operation is now on-hold since their drilling machine has broken down beyond fixing. He has already used most of his funds in fixing it before. He has a deadline to meet and the only option is to buy a new machine worth us$ 178k. If he can’t finish the project, he’ll be sued for breach of contract. He asked if i could loan him money. I was in denial, that i should give people the benefit of the doubt. So i agreed to transfer sgd3000, an amount that i am prepared to lose. I told him that it’s the best i could offer to show my sincerity. So he asked me to transfer to his agent’s account in bangkok bank. He contacted me again saying he just needed a few more to buy the machine but this time i declined. I only found out about the scam and reported it right away.

1. he's not in sg, he's in shanghai. 1st red flag, as someone keen on dating should be in same location as you, in order to meet up. his reason was he always comes to sg for business & thinking of settling down & get a pr. he will visit sg in sep.
2. he asked for whatsapp, the number used to whatsapp is malaysia country code +60 he said this number he used when he went for business trip to malaysia, i asked him when was his last visit to malaysia, he said 2 yrs ago. WHILE I READ ONLINE WHATSAPP IS BANNED IN CHINA UNLESS YOU USE VPN. so i asked if he used vpn, his answer was no i used mobile data, when my data finished i will use vpn. i really want to laugh, this guy did not understand what he was saying. this whole conversation with him is another red flag.

3. he shared about trading gold using metatrader 4 (mt4). asked me to download & open demo account. i'm actually a trader myself & used mt4 for forex trading, but i pretend & play along with him. the broker he's using is glluck, you can find the name in mt4 & website of the company (based in us), everything looks legit. only that when i googled for review of glluck, there was a post saying this company not regulated & warn to stay away. he said he has ""teacher"" who know very well the timing to trade, once the teacher tells him when to trade he will share with me so we can trade at same time. he texted me to trade that night, but i didn't reply his message, so he was trying to call me twice, i didn't answer. after that he showed me screen shot of his trading profit 35,100 usd. to trade with this profit, you need to have a least usd100k capital. if he could make this much in one night, he won't be sharing with a stranger whom he never met. after that night i didn't continue to chat with him because i knew from the beginning this guy is a scam. i just wanted to know what's the scam tactic since this type of scam was not heard before in sg. i did a google search, it's very common in china and hkg, they use mt4 so it looks legit, they will then manipulate the broker system (or create fake broker), they will make you create live account after trying demo account, let you earn money from trading, but later the more you put in, you won't be able to get the money back.",Name: john,Contact: 601129639700,

Anonymous , 29 Jun 2021,Loan Scam,"I was trying to find a loan of $10,000 and therefore, i would search on the internet to look out for some licensed money lenders. On 1 night, i decided to find a website and fill up my particulars such as my name, phone number and email address as i thought that the loan website was rather interesting in giving out its interest rates. On the following day, i was contacted by a whatsapp number and this number represents its company, ""lending bee pte ltd"". I chatted with this number and they sound like they are a legitimate business. Eventually we came to an agreement that i have to pay an upfront of $2,000 for admin & stamp charges which i've paid too before the approval of my loan as the loan officer said that my $2,000 would be refundable at the end of my loan. However, after paying of the $2,000, they demanded another $1,300 to activate my case and to access their banking accounts. I found it suspicious as there is a hidden fee which I did not sign in the imposter contract. I therefore knew that it was a scam and decided to call my bank to tell them about the problems that I've faced and made a police report immediately. I now knew that singapore licensed money lenders are not allowed to advertise their services online and that it will always be safer to acquire a loan at their actual office instead of doing it online.

I tried to withdraw my $ but the customer service told me withdrawal system under maintenance and asked me to check after a few days. I never got my money back until now and that site and devin have both vanished.

Anonymous , 18 Jun 2021,Job Scam,"it had been a while since it is happened on 28.05.2021 but i am sharing the stories now. I received the Whatsapp about the job offer for affiliate marketing. out of the curiosity, I had click the link and ask for the it. the scammer had directed me to a group chat which around 15 people.. in the group chat, there is a lot of scammers doing the task and forward the bank remittance receipts/ evidence after the task done. furthermore, they directed me to ask in person for the job offer. the jobs actually required us to click to the link provided, add to the cart, screenshot and transfer to the selected bank account that given by them. IN the return, they will transfer back the amount to us together with 10% rebate. for tc he first 3 job that i done, they did return my principal together with the 10% rebate. after i done 3 jobs, they ask me to join another vip group chat and claimed that the jobs done will be 20% rebate.

From the 4th job that I've carried out, they planned not to return my money. They claimed that the system has frozen my account hence i need to carry out 5th job to unfreeze it. after I've done 5th job, they did not return my money and yet i keep asking to return my money without rebate as i just want to get back my money that transferred. they claimed that my account has been unfreeze but i need to carry out 6th job in order to get back the money. i had no choice but just to do it. so i carry 7th job and they claimed it is ACCELERATED job which all the vip member had to do it. i had carry it without any doubt and they keep give me reason to carry another job until i had transferred out all my money to them. they even asked me to borrow from relative and friend to carry out the job as i told them that i had no more money and i had kids to feed.

they keep insulted me and ask me to transferred. i know i had been scammed after my hubby sent me the related stories about this but it is too late. it is my nightmare in one day and i even lost all my savings all these year.

i had lost about SGD72,000 due to the greed. i am regret everyday and hopefully the police can catch the scammers so that i can recover some of the money lost. hopefully there is no more victims after i shared the stories. the online platform they using is shopee, now they turned to lazada.",Name: Justine/ mr liew,Contact: 82032301,

After 1 week i kepT asking for the account number for repaYment but ray Told me to pay $150 first for deferment even though i did not ask for any deferment to the test loan.

A few days later, he gave me another account number and told me that the repayment amount was $650 even though i had already paid $150 before. He mentioned that the initial $150 would be “refunded” to me along with the $3000 loan. That’s when i figured that i had been scammed.

Not wanting to deal with any harassment, I transferred the $650 to that account number and told ray to cancel my initial loan application. I then made a police report.

He packaged himself as a hong kong mixed with korea borned orthopedic surgeon who worked for the American red cross association in new york. But presently in korea visiting his mum. Once he is done with his last contract with red cross,he will come to relocate to singapore to set up a clinic. He has an apartment in marina bay.

Every day, we will exchange messages but he seemed to be very busy. It took few hours for every message to be replied. I never think much why he is using a whats app business account. For 7 days, he appeared to be very sweet to me, calling me his dear/baby/queen etc. He will send me photos of him doing surgery and giving lecture. His english in our messages were so good and properly written.

I had experience online dating before, even with foreigners. Usually they will want to chat or video call with us once they like our conversation. So i am curious, i started requesting for virtual date with Dr david. He evaded my requests twice.

On my 8th day with him, my friend sent me a link to read about all the scam stories here. I decided that, i must chat or see him on video. Since day by day i got emotional attached to his messages. He tried to run away from my requests as usual. But finally he tried making me happy by saying to call me by the end of the day.

I was prepared that he will find excuses in not calling me eventually. But he did and i was in total shockness. He sounded like an Nigerian to me and he quickly explained that he been alot of missions and his accent just change. Quickly, i ended the call in 15mins. Then i told my friend who decided to use all the pictures he gave me to do an image search in korea website. To our astonishment, we found out that the pictures are all taken from an instagram of a korean cosmetic surgeon.
